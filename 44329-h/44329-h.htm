<p class="center chap pt2">PREFACE.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> disproportion, between the length of time occupied in
the preparation of this volume, and the slightness of apparent
result, is so vexatious to me, and must seem so strange to the
reader, that he will perhaps bear with my stating some of the
matters which have employed or interrupted me between 1855
and 1860. I needed rest after finishing the fourth volume, and
did little in the following summer. The winter of 1856 was
spent in writing the &ldquo;Elements of Drawing,&rdquo; for which I thought
there was immediate need; and in examining with more attention
than they deserved some of the modern theories of political
economy, to which there was necessarily reference in my addresses
at Manchester. The Manchester Exhibition then gave
me some work, chiefly in its magnificent Reynolds&rsquo; constellation;
and thence I went on into Scotland, to look at Dumblane and
Jedburgh, and some other favorite sites of Turner&rsquo;s; which I had
not all seen, when I received notice from Mr. Wornum that he
had obtained for me permission, from the Trustees of the National
Gallery, to arrange, as I thought best, the Turner drawings
belonging to the nation; on which I returned to London
immediately.</p>

<p>In seven tin boxes in the lower room of the National Gallery
I found upwards of nineteen thousand pieces of paper, drawn
upon by Turner in one way or another. Many on both sides;
some with four, five, or six subjects on each side (the pencil point
digging spiritedly through from the foregrounds of the front into
the tender pieces of sky on the back); some in chalk, which the
touch of the finger would sweep away;<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> others in ink, rotted
into holes; others (some splendid colored drawings among them)
long eaten away by damp and mildew, and falling into dust at the
edges, in capes and bays of fragile decay; others worm-eaten, some
mouse-eaten, many torn half-way through; numbers doubled
(quadrupled, I should say) up into four, being Turner&rsquo;s favorite
mode of packing for travelling; nearly all rudely flattened out from
the bundles in which Turner had finally rolled them up and
squeezed them into his drawers in Queen Anne Street. Dust of
thirty years&rsquo; accumulation, black, dense, and sooty, lay in the rents
of the crushed and crumpled edges of these flattened bundles,
looking like a jagged black frame, and producing altogether unexpected
effects in brilliant portions of skies, whence an accidental
or experimental finger mark of the first bundle-unfolder had
swept it away.</p>

<p>About half, or rather more, of the entire number consisted of
pencil sketches, in flat oblong pocket-books, dropping to pieces
at the back, tearing laterally whenever opened, and every drawing
rubbing itself into the one opposite. These first I paged
with my own hand; then unbound; and laid every leaf separately
in a clean sheet of perfectly smooth writing paper, so that
it might receive no farther injury. Then, enclosing the contents
and boards of each book (usually ninety-two leaves, more or less
drawn on both sides, with two sketches on the boards at the beginning
and end) in a separate sealed packet, I returned it to its
tin box. The loose sketches needed more trouble. The dust
had first to be got off them (from the chalk ones it could only
be blown off); then they had to be variously flattened; the
torn ones to be laid down, the loveliest guarded, so as to prevent
all future friction; and four hundred of the most characteristic
framed and glazed, and cabinets constructed for them
which would admit of their free use by the public. With two
assistants, I was at work all the autumn and winter of 1857, every
day, all day long, and often far into the night.</p>

<p>The manual labor would not have hurt me; but the excitement
involved in seeing unfolded the whole career of Turner&rsquo;s
mind during his life, joined with much sorrow at the state in
which nearly all his most precious work had been left, and with
great anxiety, and heavy sense of responsibility besides, were very
trying; and I have never in my life felt so much exhausted as
when I locked the last box, and gave the keys to Mr. Wornum,
in May, 1858. Among the later colored sketches, there was one
magnificent series, which appeared to be of some towns along the
course of the Rhine on the north of Switzerland. Knowing that
these towns were peculiarly liable to be injured by modern railroad
works, I thought I might rest myself by hunting down these
Turner subjects, and sketching what I could of them, in order
to illustrate his compositions.</p>

<p>As I expected, the subjects in question were all on, or near,
that east and west reach of the Rhine between Constance and
Basle. Most of them are of Rheinfelden, Seckingen, Lauffenbourg,
Schaffhausen, and the Swiss Baden.</p>

<p>Having made what notes were possible to me of these subjects
in the summer (one or two are used in this volume), I was
crossing Lombardy in order to examine some points of the shepherd
character in the Vaudois valleys, thinking to get my book
finished next spring; when I unexpectedly found some good
Paul Veroneses at Turin. There were several questions respecting
the real motives of Venetian work that still troubled me not
a little, and which I had intended to work out in the Louvre;
but seeing that Turin was a good place wherein to keep out of
people&rsquo;s way, I settled there instead, and began with Veronese&rsquo;s
Queen of Sheba;&mdash;when, with much consternation, but more delight,
I found that I had never got to the roots of the moral
power of the Venetians, and that they needed still another and a
very stern course of study. There was nothing for it but to give
up the book for that year. The winter was spent mainly in trying
to get at the mind of Titian; not a light winter&rsquo;s task; of
which the issue, being in many ways very unexpected to me (the
reader will find it partly told towards the close of this volume),
necessitated my going in the spring to Berlin, to see Titian&rsquo;s portrait
of Lavinia there, and to Dresden to see the Tribute Money,
the elder Lavinia, and girl in white, with the flag fan. Another
portrait, at Dresden, of a lady in a dress of rose and gold,
by me unheard of before, and one of an admiral, at Munich, had
like to have kept me in Germany all summer.</p>

<p>Getting home at last, and having put myself to arrange materials
of which it was not easy, after so much interruption, to
recover the command;&mdash;which also were now not reducible to a
single volume&mdash;two questions occurred in the outset, one in the
section on vegetation, respecting the origin of wood; the other
in the section on sea, respecting curves of waves; to neither of
which, from botanist or mathematicians, any sufficient answer
seemed obtainable.</p>

<p>In other respects also the section on the sea was wholly unsatisfactory
to me: I knew little of ships, nothing of blue open
water. Turner&rsquo;s pathetic interest in the sea, and his inexhaustible
knowledge of shipping, deserved more complete and accurate
illustration than was at all possible to me; and the mathematical
difficulty lay at the beginning of all demonstration of facts. I
determined to do this piece of work well, or not at all, and threw
the proposed section out of this volume. If I ever am able to do
what I want with it (and this is barely probable), it will be a
separate book; which, on other accounts, I do not regret, since
many persons might be interested in studies of the shipping of
the old Nelson times, and of the sea-waves and sailor character of
all times, who would not care to encumber themselves with five
volumes of a work on Art.</p>

<p>The vegetation question had, however, at all cost, to be made
out as best might be; and again lost me much time. Many of
the results of this inquiry, also, can only be given, if ever, in a
detached form.</p>

<p>During these various discouragements, the preparation of the
Plates could not go on prosperously. Drawing is difficult enough,
undertaken in quietness: it is impossible to bring it to any point
of fine rightness with half-applied energy.</p>

<p>Many experiments were made in hope of expressing Turner&rsquo;s
peculiar execution and touch by facsimile. They cost time, and
strength, and, for the present, have failed; many elaborate drawings,
made during the winter of 1858, having been at last thrown
aside. Some good may afterwards come of these; but certainly
not by reduction to the size of the page of this book, for which,
even of smaller subjects, I have not prepared the most interesting,
for I do not wish the possession of any effective and valuable
engravings from Turner to be contingent on the purchasing a
book of mine.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>Feebly and faultfully, therefore, yet as well as I can do it under
these discouragements, the book is at last done; respecting the
general course of which, it will be kind and well if the reader
will note these few points that follow.</p>

<p>The first volume was the expansion of a reply to a magazine
article; and was not begun because I then thought myself qualified
to write a systematic treatise on Art; but because I at least
knew, and knew it to be demonstrable, that Turner was right
and true, and that his critics were wrong, false, and base. At that
time I had seen much of nature, and had been several times in
Italy, wintering once in Rome; but had chiefly delighted in northern
art, beginning, when a mere boy, with Rubens and Rembrandt.
It was long before I got quit of a boy&rsquo;s veneration for Rubens&rsquo;
physical art-power; and the reader will, perhaps, on this ground
forgive the strong expressions of admiration for Rubens, which,
to my great regret, occur in the first volume.</p>

<p>Finding myself, however, engaged seriously in the essay, I
went, before writing the second volume, to study in Italy; where
the strong reaction from the influence of Rubens threw me at
first too far under that of Angelico and Raphael, and, which was
the worst harm that came of that Rubens influence, blinded me
long to the deepest qualities of Venetian art; which, the reader
may see by expressions occurring not only in the second, but even
in the third and fourth volumes, I thought, however powerful,
yet partly luxurious and sensual, until I was led into the final
inquiries above related.</p>

<p>These oscillations of temper, and progressions of discovery,
extending over a period of seventeen years, ought not to diminish
the reader&rsquo;s confidence in the book. Let him be assured of this,
that unless important changes are occurring in his opinions continually,
all his life long, not one of those opinions can be on
any questionable subject true. All true opinions are living, and
show their life by being capable of nourishment; therefore of
change. But their change is that of a tree&mdash;not of a cloud.</p>

<p>In the main aim and principle of the book, there is no variation,
from its first syllable to its last. It declares the perfectness
and eternal beauty of the work of God; and tests all work of
man by concurrence with, or subjection to that. And it differs
from most books, and has a chance of being in some respects better
for the difference, in that it has not been written either for
fame, or for money, or for conscience-sake, but of necessity.</p>

<p>It has not been written for praise. Had I wished to gain
present reputation, by a little flattery adroitly used in some
places, a sharp word or two withheld in others, and the substitution
of verbiage generally for investigation, I could have made the
circulation of these volumes tenfold what it has been in modern
society. Had I wished for future fame, I should have written
one volume, not five. Also, it has not been written for money.
In this wealth-producing country, seventeen years&rsquo; labor could
hardly have been invested with less chance of equivalent return.</p>

<p>Also, it has not been written for conscience-sake. I had no
definite hope in writing it; still less any sense of its being required
of me as a duty. It seems to me, and seemed always,
probable, that I might have done much more good in some other
way. But it has been written of necessity. I saw an injustice
done, and tried to remedy it. I heard falsehood taught, and was
compelled to deny it. Nothing else was possible to me. I knew
not how little or how much might come of the business, or
whether I was fit for it; but here was the lie full set in front of
me, and there was no way round it, but only over it. So that,
as the work changed like a tree, it was also rooted like a tree&mdash;not
where it would, but where need was; on which, if any fruit
grow such as you can like, you are welcome to gather it without
thanks; and so far as it is poor or bitter, it will be your justice
to refuse it without reviling.</p>

<p><a name="ft1a" id="ft1a" href="#fa1a"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The best book of studies for his great shipwrecks contained about a
quarter of a pound of chalk débris, black and white, broken off the crayons
with which Turner had drawn furiously on both sides of the leaves; every
leaf, with peculiar foresight and consideration of difficulties to be met by
future mounters, containing half of one subject on the front of it, and half
of another on the back.</p>

<p><a name="ft2a" id="ft2a" href="#fa2a"><span class="fn">2</span></a>  To Mr. Armytage, Mr. Cuff, and Mr. Cousen, I have to express my
sincere thanks for the patience, and my sincere admiration of the skill, with
which they have helped me. Their patience, especially, has been put to
severe trial by the rewardless toil required to produce facsimiles of drawings
in which the slightness of subject could never attract any due notice to the
excellence of workmanship.</p>

<p>Aid, just as disinterested, and deserving of as earnest acknowledgment,
has been given me by Miss Byfield, in her faultless facsimiles of my careless
sketches; by Miss O. Hill, who prepared the copies which I required from
portions of the pictures of the old masters; and by Mr. Robin Allen, in accurate
line studies from nature, of which, though only one is engraved in
this volume, many others have been most serviceable, both to it and to me.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE EARTH-VEIL.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. &ldquo;To</span> dress it and to keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That, then, was to be our work. Alas! what work have we
set ourselves upon instead! How have we ravaged the garden
instead of kept it&mdash;feeding our war-horses with its flowers, and
splintering its trees into spear-shafts!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And at the East a flaming sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is its flame quenchless? and are those gates that keep the
way indeed passable no more? or is it not rather that we no more
desire to enter? For what can we conceive of that first Eden
which we might not yet win back, if we chose? It was a place
full of flowers, we say. Well: the flowers are always striving to
grow wherever we suffer them; and the fairer, the closer. There
may indeed have been a Fall of Flowers, as a Fall of Man; but
assuredly creatures such as we are can now fancy nothing lovelier
than roses and lilies, which would grow for us side by side, leaf
overlapping leaf, till the Earth was white and red with them, if
we cared to have it so. And Paradise was full of pleasant shades
and fruitful avenues. Well: what hinders us from covering as
much of the world as we like with pleasant shade and pure blossom,
and goodly fruit? Who forbids its valleys to be covered
over with corn, till they laugh and sing? Who prevents its dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
forests, ghostly and uninhabitable, from being changed into infinite
orchards, wreathing the hills with frail-floretted snow, far
away to the half-lighted horizon of April, and flushing the face
of all the autumnal earth with glow of clustered food? But
Paradise was a place of peace, we say, and all the animals were
gentle servants to us. Well: the world would yet be a place of
peace if we were all peacemakers, and gentle service should we
have of its creatures if we gave them gentle mastery. But so
long as we make sport of slaying bird and beast, so long as we
choose to contend rather with our fellows than with our faults,
and make battlefield of our meadows instead of pasture&mdash;so long,
truly, the Flaming Sword will still turn every way, and the gates
of Eden remain barred close enough, till we have sheathed the
sharper flame of our own passions, and broken down the closer
gates of our own hearts.</p>

<p>§ 2. I have been led to see and feel this more and more, as I
considered the service which the flowers and trees, which man
was at first appointed to keep, were intended to render to him in
return for his care; and the services they still render to him, as
far as he allows their influence, or fulfils his own task towards
them. For what infinite wonderfulness there is in this vegetation,
considered, as indeed it is, as the means by which the earth
becomes the companion of man&mdash;his friend and his teacher! In
the conditions which we have traced in its rocks, there could only
be seen preparation for his existence;&mdash;the characters which enable
him to live on it safely, and to work with it easily&mdash;in all
these it has been inanimate and passive; but vegetation is to it
as an imperfect soul, given to meet the soul of man. The earth
in its depths must remain dead and cold, incapable except of
slow crystalline change; but at its surface, which human beings
look upon and deal with, it ministers to them through a veil of
strange intermediate being; which breathes, but has no voice;
moves, but cannot leave its appointed place; passes through life
without consciousness, to death without bitterness; wears the
beauty of youth, without its passion; and declines to the weakness
of age, without its regret.</p>

<p>§ 3. And in this mystery of intermediate being, entirely subordinate
to us, with which we can deal as we choose, having just
the greater power as we have the less responsibility for our treatment
of the unsuffering creature, most of the pleasures which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
need from the external world are gathered, and most of the lessons
we need are written, all kinds of precious grace and teaching
being united in this link between the Earth and Man: wonderful
in universal adaptation to his need, desire, and discipline; God&rsquo;s
daily preparation of the earth for him, with beautiful means of
life. First a carpet to make it soft for him; then, a colored
fantasy of embroidery thereon; then, tall spreading of foliage to
shade him from sunheat, and shade also the fallen rain, that it
may not dry quickly back into the clouds, but stay to nourish the
springs among the moss. Stout wood to bear this leafage: easily
to be cut, yet tough and light, to make houses for him, or instruments
(lance-shaft, or plough-handle, according to his temper);
useless it had been, if harder; useless, if less fibrous; useless, if
less elastic. Winter comes, and the shade of leafage falls away,
to let the sun warm the earth; the strong boughs remain, breaking
the strength of winter winds. The seeds which are to prolong
the race, innumerable according to the need, are made beautiful
and palatable, varied into infinitude of appeal to the fancy of
man, or provision for his service: cold juice, or glowing spice, or
balm, or incense, softening oil, preserving resin, medicine of
styptic, febrifuge, or lulling charm: and all these presented in
forms of endless change. Fragility or force, softness and strength,
in all degrees and aspects; unerring uprightness, as of temple
pillars, or undivided wandering of feeble tendrils on the ground;
mighty resistances of rigid arm and limb to the storms of ages,
or wavings to and fro with faintest pulse of summer streamlet.
Roots cleaving the strength of rock, or binding the transience
of the sand; crests basking in sunshine of the desert, or hiding
by dripping spring and lightless cave; foliage far tossing in
entangled fields beneath every wave of ocean&mdash;clothing with
variegated, everlasting films, the peaks of the trackless mountains,
or ministering at cottage doors to every gentlest passion and
simplest joy of humanity.</p>

<p>§ 4. Being thus prepared for us in all ways, and made beautiful,
and good for food, and for building, and for instruments of
our hands, this race of plants, deserving boundless affection and
admiration from us, become, in proportion to their obtaining it,
a nearly perfect test of our being in right temper of mind and
way of life; so that no one can be far wrong in either who loves
the trees enough, and every one is assuredly wrong in both, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
does not love them, if his life has brought them in his way. It
is clearly possible to do without them, for the great companionship
of the sea and sky are all that sailors need; and many a
noble heart has been taught the best it had to learn between dark
stone walls. Still if human life be cast among trees at all, the
love borne to them is a sure test of its purity. And it is a sorrowful
proof of the mistaken ways of the world that the &ldquo;country,&rdquo;
in the simple sense of a place of fields and trees, has hitherto
been the source of reproach to its inhabitants, and that the
words &ldquo;countryman,&rdquo; &ldquo;rustic,&rdquo; &ldquo;clown,&rdquo; &ldquo;paysan,&rdquo; &ldquo;villager,&rdquo;
still signify a rude and untaught person, as opposed to the words
&ldquo;townsman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen.&rdquo; We accept this usage of words, or
the evil which it signifies, somewhat too quietly; as if it were quite
necessary and natural that country-people should be rude, and
towns-people gentle. Whereas I believe that the result of each
mode of life may, in some stages of the world&rsquo;s progress, be the
exact reverse; and that another use of words may be forced upon
us by a new aspect of facts, so that we may find ourselves saying:
&ldquo;Such and such a person is very gentle and kind&mdash;he is quite
rustic; and such and such another person is very rude and ill-taught&mdash;he
is quite urbane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 5. At all events, cities have hitherto gained the better part
of their good report through our evil ways of going on in the
world generally;&mdash;chiefly and eminently through our bad habit
of fighting with each other. No field, in the middle ages, being
safe from devastation, and every country lane yielding easier passage
to the marauders, peacefully-minded men necessarily congregated
in cities, and walled themselves in, making as few cross-country
roads as possible: while the men who sowed and reaped
the harvests of Europe were only the servants or slaves of the
barons. The disdain of all agricultural pursuits by the nobility,
and of all plain facts by the monks, kept educated Europe in a
state of mind over which natural phenomena could have no
power; body and intellect being lost in the practice of war without
purpose, and the meditation of words without meaning.
Men learned the dexterity with sword and syllogism, which they
mistook for education, within cloister and tilt-yard; and looked
on all the broad space of the world of God mainly as a place for
exercise of horses, or for growth of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span></p>

<p>§ 6. There is a beautiful type of this neglect of the perfectness
of the Earth&rsquo;s beauty, by reason of the passions of men, in
that picture of Paul Uccello&rsquo;s of the battle of Sant&rsquo; Egidio,<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in
which the armies meet on a country road beside a hedge of wild
roses; the tender red flowers tossing above the helmets, and
glowing between the lowered lances. For in like manner the
whole of Nature only shone hitherto for man between the tossing
of helmet-crests; and sometimes I cannot but think of the trees
of the earth as capable of a kind of sorrow, in that imperfect
life of theirs, as they opened their innocent leaves in the warm
spring-time, in vain for men; and all along the dells of England
her beeches cast their dappled shade only where the outlaw drew
his bow, and the king rode his careless chase; and by the sweet
French rivers their long ranks of poplar waved in the twilight,
only to show the flames of burning cities, on the horizon, through
the tracery of their stems: amidst the fair defiles of the Apennines,
the twisted olive-trunks hid the ambushes of treachery;
and on their valley meadows, day by day, the lilies which were
white at the dawn were washed with crimson at sunset.</p>

<p>§ 7. And indeed I had once purposed, in this work, to show
what kind of evidence existed respecting the possible influence of
country life on men; it seeming to me, then, likely that here
and there a reader would perceive this to be a grave question,
more than most which we contend about, political or social, and
might care to follow it out with me earnestly.</p>

<p>The day will assuredly come when men will see that it is a
grave question; at which period, also, I doubt not, there will
arise persons able to investigate it. For the present, the movements
of the world seem little likely to be influenced by botanical
law; or by any other considerations respecting trees, than the
probable price of timber. I shall limit myself, therefore, to my
own simple woodman&rsquo;s work, and try to hew this book into its
final shape, with the limited and humble aim that I had in beginning
it, namely, to prove how far the idle and peaceable persons,
who have hitherto cared about leaves and clouds, have rightly
seen, or faithfully reported of them.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE LEAF ORDERS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. As</span> in our sketch of the structure of mountains it
seemed advisable to adopt a classification of their forms, which,
though inconsistent with absolute scientific precision, was convenient
for order of successive inquiry, and gave useful largeness
of view; so, and with yet stronger reason, in glancing at the
first laws of vegetable life, it will be best to follow an arrangement
easily remembered and broadly true, however incapable of
being carried out into entirely consistent detail. I say, &ldquo;with
yet stronger reason,&rdquo; because more questions are at issue among
botanists than among geologists; a greater number of classifications
have been suggested for plants than for rocks; nor is it
unlikely that those now accepted may be hereafter modified. I
take an arrangement, therefore, involving no theory; serviceable
enough for all working purposes, and sure to remain thus serviceable,
in its rough generality, whatever views may hereafter
be developed among botanists.</p>

<p>§ 2. A child&rsquo;s division of plants is into &ldquo;trees and flowers.&rdquo;
If, however, we were to take him in spring, after he had gathered
his lapful of daisies, from the lawn into the orchard, and
ask him how he would call those wreaths of richer floret, whose
frail petals tossed their foam of promise between him and the
sky, he would at once see the need of some intermediate name,
and call them, perhaps, &ldquo;tree-flowers.&rdquo; If, then, we took him
to a birch-wood, and showed him that catkins were flowers, as
well as cherry-blossoms, he might, with a little help, reach so far
as to divide all flowers into two classes; one, those that grew on
ground; and another, those that grew on trees. The botanist
might smile at such a division; but an artist would not. To
him, as the child, there is something specific and distinctive in
those rough trunks that carry the higher flowers. To him, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
makes the main difference between one plant and another,
whether it is to tell as a light upon the ground, or as a shade
upon the sky. And if, after this, we asked for a little help
from the botanist, and he were to lead us, leaving the blossoms,
to look more carefully at leaves and buds, we should find ourselves
able in some sort to justify, even to him, our childish
classification. For our present purposes, justifiable or not, it is
the most suggestive and convenient. Plants are, indeed, broadly
referable to two great classes. The first we may, perhaps, not
inexpediently call <span class="scs">TENTED PLANTS</span>. They live in encampments,
on the ground, as lilies; or on surfaces of rock, or stems of
other plants, as lichens and mosses. They live&mdash;some for a year,
some for many years, some for myriads of years; but, perishing,
they pass as the tented Arab passes; they leave <i>no memorials of
themselves</i>, except the seed, or bulb, or root which is to perpetuate
the race.</p>

<p>§ 3. The other great class of plants we may perhaps best call
<span class="scs">BUILDING PLANTS</span>. These will not live on the ground, but
eagerly raise edifices above it. Each works hard with solemn
forethought all its life. Perishing, it leaves its work in the form
which will be most useful to its successors&mdash;its own monument,
and their inheritance. These architectural edifices we call
&ldquo;Trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be thought that this nomenclature already involves a
theory. But I care about neither the nomenclature, nor about
anything questionable in my description of the classes. The
reader is welcome to give them what names he likes, and to render
what account of them he thinks fittest. But to us, as
artists, or lovers of art, this is the first and most vital question
concerning a plant: &ldquo;Has it a fixed form or a changing one?
Shall I find it always as I do to-day&mdash;this Parnassia palustris&mdash;with
one leaf and one flower? or may it some day have incalculable
pomp of leaves and unmeasured treasure of flowers?
Will it rise only to the height of a man&mdash;as an ear of corn&mdash;and
perish like a man; or will it spread its boughs to the sea and
branches to the river, and enlarge its circle of shade in heaven
for a thousand years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 4. This, I repeat, is the <i>first</i> question I ask the plant.
And as it answers, I range it on one side or the other, among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
those that rest or those that toil: tent-dwellers, who toil not,
neither do they spin; or tree-builders, whose days are as the
days of the people. I find again, on farther questioning these
plants who rest, that one group of them does indeed rest always,
contentedly, on the ground, but that those of another group,
more ambitious, emulate the builders; and though they cannot
build rightly, raise for themselves pillars out of the remains of
past generations, on which they themselves, living the life of St.
Simeon Stylites, are called, by courtesy, Trees; being, in fact,
many of them (palms, for instance) quite as stately as real
trees.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>These two classes we might call earth-plants, and pillar-plants.</p>

<p>§ 5. Again, in questioning the true builders as to their modes
of work, I find that they also are divisible into two great classes.
Without in the least wishing the reader to accept the fanciful
nomenclature, I think he may yet most conveniently remember
these as &ldquo;Builders with the shield,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Builders with the
sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Builders with the shield have expanded leaves, more or less
resembling shields, partly in shape, but still more in office; for
under their lifted shadow the young bud of the next year is kept
from harm. These are the gentlest of the builders, and live in
pleasant places, providing food and shelter for man. Builders
with the sword, on the contrary, have sharp leaves in the shape
of swords, and the young buds, instead of being as numerous as
the leaves, crouching each under a leaf-shadow, are few in number,
and grow fearlessly, each in the midst of a sheaf of swords.
These builders live in savage places, are sternly dark in color,
and though they give much help to man by their merely physical
strength, they (with few exceptions) give him no food, and
imperfect shelter. Their mode of building is ruder than that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
the shield-builders, and they in many ways resemble the pillar-plants
of the opposite order. We call them generally &ldquo;Pines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 6. Our work, in this section, will lie only among the shield-builders,
sword-builders, and plants of rest. The Pillar-plants
belong, for the most part, to other climates. I could not
analyze them rightly; and the labor given to them would be
comparatively useless for our present purposes. The chief mystery
of vegetation, so far as respects external form, is among the
fair shield-builders. These, at least, we must examine fondly
and earnestly.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

description given of them in books, nor do I know how far some of their

whatever errors it may involve, provokes the curiosity of the reader so as to
lead him to seek for more and better knowledge, it will do all the service I
hope from it.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE BUD.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. If</span> you gather in summer time an outer spray of any
shield-leaved tree, you will find it consists of a slender rod,
throwing out leaves, perhaps on every side, perhaps on two sides
only, with usually a cluster of closer leaves at the end. In order
to understand its structure, we must reduce it to a simple general
type. Nay, even to a very inaccurate type. For a tree-branch
is essentially a complex thing, and no &ldquo;simple&rdquo; type can, therefore,
be a right one.</p>

<p>This type I am going to give you is full of fallacies and inaccuracies;
but out of these fallacies we will bring the truth, by
casting them aside one by one.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 390px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:341px; height:328px" src="images/img026.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 2. Let the tree spray be represented under one of these two
types, <span class="scs">A</span> or <span class="scs">B</span>, Fig. 1, the cluster
at the end being in each case supposed
to consist of three leaves
only (a most impertinent supposition,
for it must at least have
four, only the fourth would be in
a puzzling perspective in <span class="scs">A</span>, and
hidden behind the central leaf in
<span class="scs">B</span>). So, receive this false type
patiently. When leaves are set
on the stalk one after another, as
in <span class="scs">A</span>, they are called &ldquo;alternate;&rdquo;
when placed as in <span class="scs">B</span>, &ldquo;opposite.&rdquo; It is necessary you should
remember this not very difficult piece of nomenclature.</p>

<p>If you examine the branch you have gathered, you will see
that for some little way below the full-leaf cluster at the end,
the stalk is smooth, and the leaves are set regularly on it. But
at six, eight, or ten inches down, there comes an awkward knot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
something seems to have gone wrong, perhaps another spray
branches off there; at all events, the stem gets suddenly thicker,
and you may break it there (probably) easier than anywhere else.</p>

<p>That is the junction of two stories of the building. The
smooth piece has all been done this summer. At the knot the
foundation was left during the winter.</p>

<p>The year&rsquo;s work is called a &ldquo;shoot.&rdquo; I shall be glad if you
will break it off to look at; as my <span class="scs">A</span> and <span class="scs">B</span> types are supposed to
go no farther down than the knot.</p>

<p>The alternate form <span class="scs">A</span> is more frequent than <span class="scs">B</span>, and some
botanists think includes <span class="scs">B</span>. We will, therefore, begin with it.</p>

<p>§ 3. If you look close at the figure, you will see small projecting
points at the roots of the leaves. These represent buds,
which you may find, most probably, in the shoot you have in
your hand. Whether you find them or not, they are there&mdash;visible,
or latent, does not matter. Every leaf has assuredly an
infant bud to take care of, laid tenderly, as in a cradle, just
where the leaf-stalk forms a safe niche between it and the main
stem. The child-bud is thus fondly guarded all summer; but
its protecting leaf dies in the autumn; and then the boy-bud is
put out to rough winter-schooling, by which he is prepared for
personal entrance into public life in the spring.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 200px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:54px; height:268px" src="images/img027.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Let us suppose autumn to have come, and the leaves
to have fallen. Then our <span class="scs">A</span> of Fig. I, the buds only
being left, one for each leaf, will appear as <span class="scs">A B</span>, in Fig. 2.
We will call the buds grouped at <span class="scs">B</span>, terminal buds, and
those at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, lateral buds.</p>

<p>This budded rod is the true year&rsquo;s work of the building
plant, at that part of its edifice. You may consider
the little spray, if you like, as one pinnacle of the tree-cathedral,
which has taken a year to fashion; innumerable
other pinnacles having been built at the same time
on other branches.</p>

<p>§ 4. Now, every one of these buds, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, as well as
every terminal bud, has the power and disposition to raise himself
in the spring, into just such another pinnacle as <span class="scs">A B</span> is.</p>

<p>This development is the process we have mainly to study in
this chapter; but, in the outset, let us see clearly what it is to
end in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span></p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:388px; height:533px" src="images/img028a.jpg" alt="" /></td>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 3.</span></td>
<td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Each bud, I said, has the power and disposition to make a
pinnacle of himself, but he has not always the opportunity.
What may hinder him we shall see presently. Meantime, the
reader will, perhaps, kindly
allow me to assume that
the buds <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, come to
nothing, and only the three
terminal ones build forward.
Each of these producing the
image of the first pinnacle, we
have the type for our next
summer bough of Fig. 3; in
which observe the original
shoot <span class="scs">A B</span>, has become thicker;
its lateral buds having proved
abortive, are now only seen as
little knobs on its sides. Its
terminal buds have each risen
into a new pinnacle. The central
or strongest one <span class="scs">B C</span>, has
become the very image of what his parent shoot <span class="scs">A B</span>, was last
year. The two lateral ones are weaker and shorter, one probably
longer than the other. The joint at <span class="scs">B</span> is
the knot or foundation for each shoot above
spoken of.</p>

<p>Knowing now what we are about, we will
go into closer detail.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:692px; height:1238px" src="images/img029.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">51. The Dryad&rsquo;s Toil.</td></tr></table>

<p>§ 5. Let us return to the type in Fig. 2,
of the fully accomplished summer&rsquo;s work:
the rod with its bare buds. Plate 51, opposite,
represents, of about half its real size,
an outer spray of oak in winter. It is not
growing strongly, and is as simple as possible
in ramification. You may easily see, in
each branch, the continuous piece of shoot
produced last year. The wrinkles which make
these shoots look like old branches are caused
by drying, as the stalk of a bunch of raisins
is furrowed (the oak-shoot fresh gathered is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
round as a grape-stalk). I draw them thus, because the furrows
are important clues to structure. Fig. 4 is the top of one of
these oak sprays magnified for reference. The little brackets, <i>x</i>,
<i>y</i>, &amp;c., which project beneath each bud and sustain it, are the
remains of the leaf-stalks. Those stalks were jointed at that
place, and the leaves fell without leaving a scar, only a crescent-shaped,
somewhat blank-looking flat space, which you may study
at your ease on a horse-chestnut stem, where these spaces are
very large.</p>

<p>§ 6. Now if you cut your oak spray neatly through, just
above a bud, as at <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 4, and look at it with a not very
powerful magnifier, you will find it present the
pretty section, Fig. 5.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 220px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:170px; height:178px" src="images/img031a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>That is the proper or normal section of an
oak spray. Never quite regular. Sure to have
one of the projections a little larger than the
rest, and to have its bark (the black line) not
quite regularly put round it, but exquisitely
finished, down to a little white star in the very centre, which
I have not drawn, because it would look in the woodcut black,
not white; and be too conspicuous.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: left; width: 230px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:177px; height:236px" src="images/img031b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>The oak spray, however, will not keep this
form unchanged for an instant. Cut it through
a little way above your first section, and you
will find the largest projection is increasing till,
just where it opens<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> at last into the leaf-stalk,
its section is Fig. 6. If, therefore, you choose
to consider every interval between bud and bud
as one story of your tower or pinnacle, you
find that there is literally not a hair&rsquo;s-breadth
of the work in which the <i>plan</i> of the tower does not change. You
may see in Plate 51 that every shoot is suffused by a subtle (in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
nature an <i>infinitely</i> subtle) change of contour between bud and
bud.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:791px; height:134px" src="images/img032a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 7.</span></td></tr></table>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 240px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:192px; height:193px" src="images/img032b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 7. But farther, observe in what succession those buds are
put round the bearing stem. Let the section of the stem be
represented by the small central circle in Fig.
8; and suppose it surrounded by a <i>nearly</i> regular
pentagon (in the figure it is quite regular
for clearness&rsquo; sake). Let the first of any ascending
series of buds be represented by the
curved projection filling the nearest angle of
the pentagon at 1. Then the next bud, above,
will fill the angle at 2; the next above, at 3,
the next at 4, the next at 5. The sixth will come nearly over
the first. That is to say, each projecting portion of the section,
Fig. 5, expands into its bud, not successively, but by leaps,
always to the <i>next but one;</i> the buds being thus placed in a
nearly regular spiral order.</p>

<p>§ 8. I say nearly regular&mdash;for there are subtleties of variation
in plan which it would be merely tiresome to enter into. All
that we need care about is the general law, of which the oak spray
furnishes a striking example,&mdash;that the buds of the first great
group of alternate builders rise in a spiral order round the stem
(I believe, for the most part, the spiral proceeds from right to
left). And this spiral succession very frequently approximates
to the pentagonal order, which it takes with great accuracy in
an oak; for, merely assuming that each ascending bud places
itself as far as it can easily out of the way of the one beneath,
and yet not quite on the opposite side of the stem, we find the
interval between the two must generally approximate to that left
between 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, in Fig. 8.<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span></p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 220px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:166px; height:358px" src="images/img033.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 9. Should the interval be consistently a little <i>less</i> than
that which brings out the pentagonal structure, the plant
seems to get at first into much difficulty. For, in such case,
there is a probability of the buds falling into
a triangle, as at <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 9; and then the fourth
must come over the first, which would be inadmissible
(we shall soon see why). Nevertheless,
the plant seems to like the triangular result
for its outline, and sets itself to get out of the
difficulty with much ingenuity, by methods of
succession, which I will examine farther in the
next chapter: it being enough for us to know at
present that the puzzled, but persevering, vegetable
<i>does</i> get out of its difficulty and issues triumphantly,
and with a peculiar expression of
leafy exultation, in a hexagonal star, composed
of two distinct triangles, normally as at <span class="scs">B</span>, Fig. 9. Why the
buds do not like to be one above the other, we shall see in next
chapter. Meantime I must shortly warn the reader of what we
shall then discover, that, though we have spoken of the projections
of our pentagonal tower as if they were first built to sustain
each its leaf, they are themselves chiefly built by the leaf they
seem to sustain. Without troubling ourselves about this yet, let
us fix in our minds broadly the effective aspect of the matter,
which is all we want, by a simple practical illustration.</p>

<p>§ 10. Take a piece of stick half-an-inch thick, and a yard or
two long, and tie large knots, at any <i>equal</i> distances you choose,
on a piece of pack-thread. Then wind the pack-thread round the
stick, with any number of equidistant turns you choose, from
one end to the other, and the knots will take the position of
buds in the general type of alternate vegetation. By varying the
number of knots and the turns of the thread, you may get the
system of any tree, with the exception of one character only&mdash;viz.,
that since the shoot grows faster at one time than another,
the buds run closer together when the growth is slow. You cannot
imitate this structure by closing the coils of your string, for
that would alter the positions of your knots irregularly. The
intervals between the buds are, by this gradual acceleration or
retardation of growth, usually varied in lovely proportions. Fig.

<p>§ 11. Lastly: If the spiral be constructed so as to bring the
buds nearly on opposite sides of the stem,
though alternate in succession, the stem,
most probably, will shoot a little away from
each bud after throwing it off, and thus establish
the oscillatory form <i>b</i>, Fig. 11,
which, when the buds are placed, as in this
case, at diminishing intervals, is very beautiful.<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>§ 12. I fear this has been a tiresome
chapter; but it is necessary to master the
elementary structure, if we are to understand
anything of trees; and the reader will
therefore, perhaps, take patience enough to
look at one or two examples of the spray
structure of the second great class of builders,
in which the leaves are opposite. Nearly
all opposite-leaved trees grow, normally, like
vegetable weathercocks run to seed, with
north and south, and east and west pointers
thrown off alternately one over another, as
in Fig. 12.</p>

<p>This, I say, is the normal condition.
Under certain circumstances, north and
south pointers set themselves north-east and
south-west; this concession being acknowledged
and imitated by the east and west
pointers at the next opportunity; but, for
the present, let us keep to our simple form.</p>

<p>The first business of the budding stem,
is to get every pair of buds set accurately
at right angles to the one below. Here are some examples of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
the way it contrives this. <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 13, is the section of the stem
of a spray of box, magnified eight or nine times, just where it
throws off two of its leaves, suppose on north and south sides.
The crescents below and above are sections through the leaf-stalks
thrown off on each side. Just above this joint, the section
of the stem is <span class="scs">B</span>, which is the normal section of a box-stem, as
Fig. 5 is of an oak&rsquo;s. This, as it
ascends, becomes <span class="scs">C</span>, elongating itself
now east and west; and the
section next to <span class="scs">C</span>, would be again
A turned that way; or, taking the
succession completely through two joints, and of the real size,
it would be thus: Fig. 14.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<p>The stem of the spotted aucuba is normally hexagonal, as
that of the box is normally square. It is very dexterous and
delicate in its mode of transformation to the two sides.
Through the joint it is <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 15. Above joint, <span class="scs">B</span>, normal, passing
on into <span class="scs">C</span>, and <span class="scs">D</span> for the next joint.</p>

<p>While in the horse-chestnut, a larger tree, and, as we shall
see hereafter, therefore less regular in conduct, the section, normally
hexagonal, is much
rounded and softened into
irregularities; <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 16,
becoming, as it buds, <span class="scs">B</span> and
<span class="scs">C</span>. The dark diamond beside
<span class="scs">C</span> is a section through
a bud, in which, however
small, the quatrefoil disposition
is always seen complete:
the four little infant
leaves with a queen leaf
in the middle, all laid in
their fan-shaped feebleness,
safe in a white cloud of
miniature woollen blanket.</p>

<p>§ 13. The elementary
structure of all important
trees may, I think, thus be resolved into three principal forms:
three-leaved, Fig. 9; four-leaved, Figs. 13 to 16; and five-leaved,
Fig. 8. Or, in well-known terms, trefoil, quatrefoil,
cinqfoil. And these are essential classes, more complicated forms
being usually, it seems to me, resolvable into these, but these
not into each other. The simplest arrangement (Fig. 11), in
which the buds are nearly opposite in position, though alternate
in elevation, cannot, I believe, constitute a separate class, being
only an accidental condition of the spiral. If it did, it might be
called difoil; but the important classes are three:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>§ 14. The coincidences between beautiful architecture and
the construction of trees must more and more have become
marked in the reader&rsquo;s mind as we advanced; and if he will now
look at what I have said in other places of the use and meaning
of the trefoil, quatrefoil, and cinqfoil, in Gothic architecture, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
will see why I could hardly help thinking and speaking of all
trees as builders. But there is yet one more subtlety in their
way of building which we have not noticed. If the reader will
look carefully at the separate shoots in Plate 51, he will see that
the furrows of the stems fall in almost every case into continuous
spiral curves, carrying the whole system of buds with them.
This superinduced spiral action, of which we shall perhaps presently
discover the cause, often takes place vigorously, producing
completely twisted stems of great thickness. It is nearly always
existent slightly, giving farther grace and change to the whole
wonderful structure. And thus we have, as the final result of
one year&rsquo;s vegetative labor on any single spray, a twisted tower,
not similar at any height of its building: or (for, as we shall see
presently, it loses in diameter at each bud) a twisted spire, correspondent
somewhat in principle to the twisted spire of Dijon,
or twisted fountain of Ulm, or twisted shafts of Verona. Bossed
as it ascends with living sculpture, chiselled, not by diminution
but through increase, it rises by one consistent impulse from its
base to its minaret, ready, in spring-time, to throw round it at
the crest at once the radiance of fresh youth and the promise of
restoration after that youth has passed away. A marvellous creation:
nay might we not almost say, a marvellous creature full
of prescience in its infancy, foreboding even, in the earliest gladness
of its opening to sunshine, the hour of fainting strength
and falling leaf, and guarding under the shade of its faithful
shields the bud that is to bear its hope through winter&rsquo;s shieldless
sleep?</p>

<p>Men often look to bring about great results by violent and
unprepared effort. But it is only in fair and forecast order, &ldquo;as
the earth bringeth forth her bud,&rdquo; that righteousness and praise
may spring forth before the nations.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1d" id="ft1d" href="#fa1d"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The added portion, surrounding two of the sides of the pentagon, is
the preparation for the stalk of the leaf, which, on detaching itself from the
stem, presents variable sections, of which those numbered 1 to 4, Fig. 7, are
examples. I cannot determine the proper normal form. The bulb-shaped
spot in the heart of the uppermost of the five projections in Fig. 6 is the
root of the bud.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE LEAF.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Having</span> now some clear idea of the position of the bud,
we have next to examine the forms and structure of its shield&mdash;the
leaf which guards it. You will form the best general idea of
the flattened leaf of shield-builders by thinking of it as you
would of a mast and sail. More consistently with our classification,
we might perhaps say, by thinking always of the arm sustaining
the shield; but we should be in danger of carrying fancy
too far, and the likeness of mast and sail is closer, for the mast
tapers as the leaf-rib does, while the hand holding the uppermost
strap of the buckler clenches itself. Whichever figure we use, it
will cure us of the bad habit of imagining a leaf composed of a
short stalk with a broad expansion at the end of it. Whereas we
should always think of the stalk as running right up the leaf to
its point, and carrying the expanded, or foliate part, as the mast
of a lugger does its sail. To some extent, indeed, it has yards
also, ribs branching from the innermost one; only the yards of
the leaf will not run up and down, which is one essential function
of a sailyard.</p>

<p>§ 2. The analogy will, however, serve one step more. As the
sail must be on one side of the mast, so the expansion of a leaf
is on one side of its central rib, or of its system of ribs. It is
laid over them as if it were stretched over a frame, so that on
the upper surface it is comparatively smooth; on the lower,
barred. The understanding of the broad relations of these parts
is the principal work we have to do in this chapter.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 440px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:391px; height:231px" src="images/img040a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 3. First, then, you may roughly assume that the section of
any leaf-mast will be a crescent, as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 17 (compare Fig. 7
above). The flat side is the uppermost, the round side underneath,
and the flat or upper side caries the leaf. You can at
once see the convenience of this structure for fitting to a central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
stem. Suppose the central stem has a little hole in the centre,
<i>b</i>, Fig. 17, and that you cut it down through the middle (as
terrible knights used to cut
their enemies in the dark ages,
so that half the head fell on
one side, and half on the other):
Pull the two halves separate, <i>c</i>,
and they will nearly represent
the shape and position of opposite
leaf-ribs. In reality the
leaf-stalks have to fit themselves
to the central stem, <i>a</i>, and as we shall see presently, to lap
round it: but we must not go too fast.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 19.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 4. Now, <i>a</i>, Fig. 17, being the general type of a leaf-stalk,
Fig. 18 is the general type of the way it expands into and carries
its leaf;<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> this figure being the enlargement of a typical section
right across any leaf, the dotted lines show the under surface
foreshortened. You see I have made one side broader than the
other. I mean that. It is typically so. Nature cannot endure
two sides of a leaf to be alike. By encouraging
one side more than the other, either by
giving it more air or light, or perhaps in a
chief degree by the mere fact of the moisture
necessarily accumulating on the lower
edge when it rains, and the other always
drying first, she contrives it so, that if the
essential form or idea of the leaf be <i>a</i>, Fig.
19, the actual form will always be <i>c</i>, or an approximate to it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
one half being pushed in advance of the other, as at <i>b</i>, and all
reconciled by soft curvature, <i>c</i>. The effort of the leaf to keep
itself symmetrical rights it, however, often at the point, so that
the insertion of the stalk only makes the inequality manifest.
But it follows that the sides of a straight section across the leaf
are unequal all the way up, as in my drawing, except at one
point.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: left; width: 220px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 20.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 5. I have represented the two wings of the leaf as slightly
convex on the upper surface. This is also on
the whole a typical character. I use the expression
&ldquo;wings of the leaf,&rdquo; because supposing we
exaggerate the main rib a little, the section will
generally resemble a bad painter&rsquo;s type of a bird
(<i>a</i>, Fig. 20). Sometimes the outer edges curl
up, <i>b</i>, but an entirely concave form, <i>c</i>, is rare. When <i>b</i> is strongly
developed, closing well in, the leaf gets a good deal the look of a
boat with a keel.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 22</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 6. If now you take this oblique form of sail, and cut it into
any number of required pieces down to its mast, as in Fig. 21, <span class="scs">A</span>,
and then suppose each of the pieces to contract into studding-sails
at the side, you will have whatever type of divided leaf you choose
to shape it for. In Fig. 21, <span class="scs">A</span>, <span class="scs">B</span>, I have taken the rose as the
simplest type. The leaf is given in separate contour at <span class="scs">C</span>; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
that of the mountain ash, <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 22, suggests the original oval
form which encloses all the
subdivisions much more
beautifully. Each of the
studding-sails in this ash-leaf
looks much at first as
if he were himself a mainsail.
But you may know
him always to be a subordinate,
by observing that
the inequality of the two
sides which is brought
about by accidental influences
in the mainsail, is an
organic law in the studding-sail.
The real leaf tries to
set itself evenly on its mast;
and the inequality is only a
graceful concession to circumstances.
But the subordinate
or studding-sail is
always <i>by law</i> larger at one
side than the other; and if
he is himself again divided
into smaller sails, he will have larger sails on the lowest side, or
one more sail on the lowest side, than he has on the other. He
always wears, therefore, a servant&rsquo;s, or, at least, subordinate&rsquo;s
dress. You may know him anywhere as not the master. Even
in the ash leaflet, of which I have outlined one separately, <span class="scs">B</span>, Fig.
22, this is clearly seen; but it is much more distinct in more
finely divided leaves.<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>§ 7. Observe, then, that leaves are broadly divisible into mainsails
and studding-sails; but that the word <i>leaf</i> is properly to
be used only of the mainsail; leaflet is the best word for minor
divisions; and whether these minor members are only separated
by deep cuts, or become complete stalked leaflets, still they are
always to be thought of merely as parts of a true leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span></p>

<p>It follows from the mode of their construction that leaflets
must always lie more or less <i>flat</i>, or edge to edge, in a continuous
plane. This position distinguishes them from true leaves as
much as their oblique form, and distinguishes them with the
same delicate likeness of system; for as the true leaf takes, accidentally
and partially, the oblique outline which is legally required
in the subordinate, so the true leaf takes accidentally and
partially the flat disposition which is legally required in the subordinate.
And this point of position we must now study.
Henceforward, throughout this chapter, the reader will please
note that I speak only of true <i>leaves</i>, not of <i>leaflets</i>.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: left; width: 270px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>§ 8. LAW I. <span class="sc">The Law of Deflection.</span>&mdash;The first law,
then, respecting position in true leaves, is
that they fall gradually back from the uppermost
one, or uppermost group. They
are never set as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 23, but always as
at <i>b</i>. The reader may see at once that they
have more room and comfort by means of
the latter arrangement. The law is carried
out with more or less distinctness according
to the habit of the plant; but is always acknowledged.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:669px; height:392px" src="images/img043b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 24.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>In strong-leaved shrubs or trees it is shown with great distinctness
and beauty: the phillyrea shoot, for instance, Fig. 24,
is almost in as true symmetry as a Greek honeysuckle ornament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
In the hawthorn shoot, central in Plate 52, opposite, the law is
seen very slightly, yet it rules all the play and fantasy of the varied
leaves, gradually depressing their lines as they are set lower.
In crowded foliage of large trees the disposition of each separate
leaf is not so manifest. For there is a strange coincidence in
this between trees and communities of men. When the community
is small, people fall more easily into their places, and
take, each in his place, a firmer standing than can be obtained
by the individuals of a great nation. The members of a vast
community are separately weaker, as an aspen or elm leaf is thin,
tremulous, and directionless, compared with the spear-like setting
and firm substance of a rhododendron or laurel leaf. The
laurel and rhododendron are like the Athenian or Florentine republics;
the aspen like England&mdash;strong-trunked enough when
put to proof, and very good for making cartwheels of, but shaking
pale with epidemic panic at every breeze. Nevertheless, the
aspen has the better of the great nation, in that if you take it
bough by bough, you shall find the gentle law of respect and
room for each other truly observed by the leaves in such broken
way as they can manage it; but in the nation you find every one
scrambling for his neighbor&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>This, then, is our first law, which we may generally call the
Law of Deflection; or, if the position of the leaves with respect
to the root be regarded, of Radiation. The second is more curious,
and we must go back over our ground a little to get at it.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">52. Spirals of Thorn.</td></tr></table>

<p>§ 9. LAW II. <span class="sc">The Law of Succession.</span>&mdash;From what we
saw of the position of buds, it follows that in every tree the
leaves at the end of the spray, taking the direction given them
by the uppermost cycle or spiral of the buds, will fall naturally
into a starry group, expressive of the order of their growth. In
an oak we shall have a cluster of five leaves, in a horse-chestnut
of four, in a rhododendron of six, and so on. But observe, if we
draw the oak-leaves all equal, as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 25, or the chestnut&rsquo;s
(<i>b</i>), or the rhododendron&rsquo;s (<i>c</i>), you instantly will feel, or ought
to feel, that something is wrong; that those are not foliage forms&mdash;not
even normally or typically so&mdash;but dead forms, like crystals
of snow. Considering this, and looking back to last chapter,
you will see that the buds which throw out these leaves do not
grow side by side, but one above another. In the oak and rhododendron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
all five and all six buds are at different heights; in
the chestnut, one couple is above the other couple.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:662px; height:273px" src="images/img047a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 25.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 10. Now so surely as one bud is above another, it must be
stronger or weaker than that other. The shoot may either be increasing
in strength as it advances, or declining; in either case,
the buds must vary in power, and the leaves in size. At the top
of the shoot, the last or uppermost leaves are mostly the smallest;
of course always so in spring as they develope.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:1001px; height:408px" src="images/img047b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 26.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Let us then apply these conditions to our formal figure above,
and suppose each leaf to be weaker in its order of succession.
The oak becomes as <i>a</i>, Fig. 26, the chestnut shoot as <i>b</i>, the rhododendron,
<i>c</i>. These, I should think, it can hardly be necessary
to tell the reader, are true normal forms;&mdash;respecting which one
or two points must be noticed in detail.</p>

<p>§ 11. The magnitude of the leaves in the oak star diminishes,
of course, in alternate order. The largest leaf is the lowest, 1 in
Figure 8, p. 14. While the largest leaf forms the bottom, next
it, opposite each other, come the third and fourth, in order and
magnitude, and the fifth and second form the top. An oak star
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
is, therefore, always an oblique star; but in the chestnut and
other quatrefoil trees, though the uppermost couple of leaves
must always be smaller than the lowermost couple, there appears
no geometrical reason why the opposite leaves of each couple
should vary in size. Nevertheless, they always do, so that the
quatrefoil becomes oblique as well as the cinqfoil, as you see it is
in Fig. 26.</p>

<p>The normal of four-foils is therefore as in Fig. 27, <span class="scs">A</span> (maple):
with magnitudes, in order numbered; but it often happens that
an opposite pair agree to become largest and smallest; thus giving
the pretty symmetry, Fig. 27, <span class="scs">B</span> (spotted aucuba). Of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
the quatrefoil in reality is always less formal, one pair of leaves
more or less hiding or preceding the other. Fig. 28 is the outline
of a young one in the maple.</p>

pains to follow out what we left unobserved in last chapter respecting
the way a triplicate plant gets out of its difficulties.</p>

<p>Draw a circle as in Fig. 29, and two lines, <span class="scs">AB</span>, <span class="scs">BC</span>, touching
it, equal to each other, and each divided
accurately in half where they
touch the circle, so that <span class="scs">AP</span> shall be
equal to <span class="scs">PB</span>, <span class="scs">BQ</span>, and <span class="scs">QC</span>. And let
the lines <span class="scs">AB</span> and <span class="scs">BC</span> be so placed that
a dotted line <span class="scs">AC</span>, joining their extremities,
would not be much longer
than either of them.</p>

<p>Continue to draw lines of the same
length all round the circle. Lay five
of them, <span class="scs">AB</span>, <span class="scs">BC</span>, <span class="scs">CD</span>, <span class="scs">DE</span>, <span class="scs">EF</span>. Then
join the points <span class="scs">AD</span>, <span class="scs">EB</span>, and <span class="scs">CF</span>, and you have Fig. 30, which is
a hexagon, with the following curious
properties. It has one side largest, <span class="scs">CD</span>,
two sides less, but equal to each other,
<span class="scs">AE</span> and <span class="scs">BF</span>; and three sides less still,
and equal to each other, <span class="scs">AD</span>, <span class="scs">CF</span>, and <span class="scs">BE</span>.</p>

<p>Now put leaves into this hexagon,
Fig. 31, and you will see how charmingly
the rhododendron has got out of
its difficulties. The next cycle will put
a leaf in at the gap at the top, and begin
a new hexagon. Observe, however, this geometrical figure is
only to the rhododendron what the <i>a</i> in Fig. 25 is to the oak, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
icy or dead form.  To get the living normal form we must
introduce our law of succession. That is to say, the five lines
<span class="scs">AB</span>, <span class="scs">BC</span>, &amp;c., must continually
diminish, as they proceed,
and therefore continually
approach the centre; roughly,
as in Fig. 32.</p>

<p>§ 13. I dread entering into
the finer properties of this construction,
but the reader cannot
now fail to feel their beautiful
result either in the cluster
in Fig. 26, or here in Fig. 33,
which is a richer and more
oblique one. The three leaves
of the uppermost triad are perfectly
seen, closing over the
bud; and the general form is clear, though the lower triads are
confused to the eye by unequal development, as in these complex
arrangements is almost always the case. The more difficulties
are to be encountered the more licence is given to the plant
in dealing with them, and we shall hardly ever find a rhododendron
shoot fulfilling its splendid spiral as an oak does its simple
one.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, is the actual order of ascending leaves in
four rhododendron shoots which I gather at random.</p>

<p>§ 14. LAW III. <span class="sc">The Law of Resilience.</span>&mdash;If you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
been gathering any branches from the trees I have named among
quatrefoils (the box is the best for exemplification), you have perhaps
been embarrassed by finding that the leaves, instead of
growing on four sides of the stem, did practically grow oppositely
on two. But if you look closely
at the places of their insertion,
you will find they indeed spring
on all four sides; and that in order
to take the flattened opposite position,
each leaf twists round on its
stalk, as in Fig. 35, which represents
a box-leaf magnified and
foreshortened. The leaves do this in order to avoid growing
downwards, where the position of the bough and bud would, if
the leaves regularly kept their places, involve downward growth.
The leaves always rise up on each side from beneath, and form a
flattened group, more or less distinctly in proportion to the horizontality
of the bough, and the contiguity of foliage below and
above. I shall not trouble myself to illustrate this law, as you
have only to gather a few tree-sprays to see its effect. But you
must note the resulting characters on <i>every</i> leaf; namely, that
not one leaf in a thousand grows without a fixed turn in its stalk;
warping and varying the whole of the curve on the two edges,
throughout its length, and thus producing the loveliest conditions
of its form. We shall presently trace the law of resilience farther
on a larger scale: meanwhile, in summing the results of our
inquiry thus far, let us remember that every one of these laws is
observed with varying accuracy and gentle equity, according not
only to the strength and fellowship of foliage on the spray itself,
but according to the place and circumstances of its growth.</p>

<p>§ 15. For the leaves, as we shall see immediately, are the
feeders of the plant. Their own orderly habits of succession
must not interfere with their main business of finding food.
Where the sun and air are, the leaf must go, whether it be out of
order or not. So, therefore, in any group, the first consideration
with the young leaves is much like that of young bees, how to
keep out of each other&rsquo;s way, that every one may at once leave
its neighbors as much free-air pasture as possible, and obtain a
relative freedom for itself. This would be a quite simple matter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
and produce other simply balanced forms, if each branch, with
open air all round it, had nothing to think of but reconcilement
of interests among its own leaves. But every branch has others
to meet or to cross, sharing with them, in various advantage,
what shade, or sun, or rain is to be had. Hence every single
leaf-cluster presents the general aspect of a little family, entirely
at unity among themselves, but obliged to get their living by
various shifts, concessions, and infringements of the family rules,
in order not to invade the privileges of other people in their
neighborhood.</p>

<p>§ 16. And in the arrangement of these concessions there is an
exquisite sensibility among the leaves. They do not grow each
to his own liking, till they run against one another, and then
turn back sulkily; but by a watchful instinct, far apart, they
anticipate their companions&rsquo; courses, as ships at sea, and in every
new unfolding of their edged tissue, guide themselves by the
sense of each other&rsquo;s remote presence, and by a watchful penetration
of leafy purpose in the far future. So that every shadow
which one casts on the next, and every glint of sun which each
reflects to the next, and every touch which in toss of storm each
receives from the next, aid or arrest the development of their
advancing form, and direct, as will be safest and best, the curve
of every fold and the current of every vein.</p>

<p>§ 17. And this peculiar character exists in all the structures
thus developed, that they are always visibly the result of a volition
on the part of the leaf, meeting an external force or fate, to
which it is never passively subjected. Upon it, as on a mineral
in the course of formation, the great merciless influences of the
universe, and the oppressive powers of minor things immediately
near it, act continually. Heat and cold, gravity and the other
attractions, windy pressure, or local and unhealthy restraint, must,
in certain inevitable degrees, affect the whole of its life. But it
is <i>life</i> which they affect;&mdash;a life of progress and will,&mdash;not a
merely passive accumulation of substance. This may be seen by
a single glance. The mineral,&mdash;suppose an agate in the course of
formation&mdash;shows in every line nothing but a dead submission to
surrounding force. Flowing, or congealing, its substance is here
repelled, there attracted, unresistingly to its place, and its languid
sinuosities follow the clefts of the rock that contains them, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
servile deflexion and compulsory cohesion, impotently calculable,
and cold. But the leaf, full of fears and affections, shrinks and
seeks, as it obeys. Not thrust, but awed into its retiring; not
dragged, but won to its advance; not bent aside, as by a bridle,
into new courses of growth: but persuaded and converted through
tender continuance of voluntary change.</p>

<p>§ 18. The mineral and it differing thus widely in separate
being, they differ no less in modes of companionship. The mineral
crystals group themselves neither in succession, nor in sympathy;
but great and small recklessly strive for place, and deface
or distort each other as they gather into opponent asperities.
The confused crowd fills the rock cavity, hanging together in a
glittering, yet sordid heap, in which nearly every crystal, owing
to their vain contention, is imperfect, or impure. Here and there
one, at the cost and in defiance of the rest, rises into unwarped
shape or unstained clearness. But the order of the leaves is one of
soft and subdued concession. Patiently each awaits its appointed
time, accepts its prepared place, yields its required observance.
Under every oppression of external accident, the group yet follows
a law laid down in its own heart; and all the members of it,
whether in sickness or health, in strength or languor, combine to
carry out this first and last heart law; receiving, and seeming to
desire for themselves and for each other, only life which they
may communicate, and loveliness which they may reflect.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="center chap2">LEAF ASPECTS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Before</span> following farther our inquiry into tree structure,
it will rest us, and perhaps forward our work a little, to
make some use of what we know already.</p>

<p>It results generally from what we have seen that any group
of four or five leaves presenting itself in its natural position to
the eye, consists of a series of forms connected by exquisite and
complex symmetries, and that these forms will be not only varied
in themselves, but every one of them seen under a different condition
of foreshortening.</p>

<p>The facility of drawing the group may be judged of by a
comparison. Suppose five or six boats, very beautifully built,
and sharp in the prow, to start all from one point, and the first
bearing up into the wind, the other three or four to fall off from
it in succession an equal number of points,<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> taking each, in consequence,
a different slope of deck from the stem of the sail.
Suppose, also, that the bows of these boats were transparent, so
that you could see the under sides of their decks as well as the
upper;&mdash;and that it were required of you to draw all their five
decks, the under or upper side, as their curve showed it, in true
foreshortened perspective, indicating the exact distance each
boat had reached at a given moment from the central point they
started from.</p>

<p>If you can do that, you can draw a rose-leaf. Not otherwise.</p>

<p>§ 2. When, some few years ago, the pre-Raphaelites began
to lead our wandering artists back into the eternal paths of all
great Art, and showed that whatever men drew at all, ought to
be drawn accurately and knowingly; not blunderingly nor by
guess (leaves of trees among other things): as ignorant pride on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
the one hand refused their teaching, ignorant hope caught at it
on the other. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said many a feeble young student to
himself. &ldquo;Painting is not a matter of science then, nor of
supreme skill, nor of inventive brain. I have only to go and
paint the leaves of the trees as they grow, and I shall produce
beautiful landscapes directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas! my innocent young friend. &ldquo;Paint the leaves as
they grow!&rdquo; If you can paint <i>one</i> leaf, you can paint the world.
These pre-Raphaelite laws, which you think so light, lay stern
on the strength of Apelles and Zeuxis; put Titian to thoughtful
trouble; are unrelaxed yet, and unrelaxable for ever. Paint
a leaf indeed! Above-named Titian has done it: Correggio,
moreover, and Giorgione: and Leonardo, very nearly, trying
hard. Holbein, three or four times, in precious pieces, highest
wrought. Raphael, it may be, in one or two crowns of Muse or
Sibyl. If any one else, in later times, we have to consider.</p>

<p>§ 3. At least until recently, the perception of organic leaf
form was absolutely, in all painters whatsoever, proportionate to
their power of drawing the human figure. All the great Italian
designers drew leaves thoroughly well, though none quite so
fondly as Correggio. Rubens drew them coarsely and vigorously,
just as he drew limbs. Among the inferior Dutch painters,
the leaf-painting degenerates in proportion to the diminishing
power in figure. Cuyp, Wouvermans, and Paul Potter,
paint better foliage than either Hobbima or Ruysdael.</p>

<p>§ 4. In like manner the power of treating vegetation in sculpture
is absolutely commensurate with nobleness of figure design.
The quantity, richness, or deceptive finish may be greater in
third-rate work; but in true understanding and force of arrangement
the leaf and the human figure show always parallel
skill. The leaf-mouldings of Lorenzo Ghiberti are unrivalled,
as his bas-reliefs are, and the severe foliage of the Cathedral of
Chartres is as grand as its queen-statues.</p>

<p>§ 5. The greatest draughtsmen draw leaves, like everything
else, of their full-life size in the nearest part of the picture.
They cannot be rightly drawn on any other terms. It is impossible
to reduce a group so treated without losing much of its
character; and more painfully impossible to represent by engraving
any good workman&rsquo;s handling. I intended to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
inserted in this place an engraving of the cluster of oak-leaves
above Correggio&rsquo;s Antiope in the Louvre, but it is too lovely;
and if I am able to engrave it at all, it must be separately, and
of its own size. So I draw, roughly, instead, a group of oak-leaves
on a young shoot, a little curled with autumn frost: Plate
53. I could not draw them accurately enough if I drew them in
spring. They would droop and lose their relations. Thus
roughly drawn, and losing some of their grace, by withering,
they, nevertheless, have enough left to show how noble leaf-form
is; and to prove, it seems to me, that Dutch draughtsmen do
not wholly express it. For instance, Fig. 3, Plate 54, is a facsimile
of a bit of the nearest oak foliage out of Hobbima&rsquo;s Scene
with the Water-mill, No. 131, in the Dulwich Gallery. Compared
with the real forms of oak-leaf, in Plate 53, it may, I
hope, at least enable my readers to understand, if they choose,
why, never having ceased to rate the Dutch painters for their
meanness or minuteness, I yet accepted the leaf-painting of the
pre-Raphaelites with reverence and hope.</p>

<p>§ 6. No word has been more harmfully misused than that
ugly one of &ldquo;niggling.&rdquo; I should be glad if it were entirely
banished from service and record. The only essential question
about drawing is whether it be right or wrong; that it be small
or large, swift or slow, is a matter of convenience only. But so
far as the word may be legitimately used at all, it belongs especially
to such execution as this of Hobbima&rsquo;s&mdash;execution which
substitutes, on whatever scale, a mechanical trick or habit of
hand for true drawing of known or intended forms. So long as
the work is thoughtfully directed, there is no niggling. In a
small Greek coin the muscles of the human body are as grandly
treated as in a colossal statue; and a fine vignette of Turner&rsquo;s
will show separate touches often more extended in intention,
and stronger in result, than those of his largest oil pictures. In
the vignette of the picture of Ginevra, at page 90 of Roger&rsquo;s
Italy, the forefinger touching the lip is entirely and rightly
drawn, bent at the two joints, within the length of the thirtieth
of an inch, and the whole hand within the space of one of those
&ldquo;niggling&rdquo; touches of Hobbima. But if this work were magnified,
it would be seen to be a strong and simple expression of a
hand by thick black lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span></p>

<p>§ 7. Niggling, therefore, essentially means disorganized and
mechanical work, applied on a scale which may deceive a vulgar
or ignorant person into the idea of its being true:&mdash;a definition
applicable to the whole of the leaf-painting of the Dutch landscapists
in distant effect, and for the most part to that of their
near subjects also. Cuyp and Wouvermans, as before stated,
and others, in proportion to their power over the figure, drew
leaves better in the foreground, yet never altogether well; for
though Cuyp often draws a single leaf carefully (weedy ground-vegetation
especially, with great truth), he never felt the connection
of leaves, but scattered them on the boughs at random.
Fig. 1 in Plate 54 is nearly a <i>facsimile</i> of part of the branch on
the left side in our National Gallery picture. Its entire want of
grace and organization ought to be felt at a glance, after the
work we have gone through. The average conditions of leafage-painting
among the Dutch are better represented by Fig. 2,
Plate 54, which is a piece of the foliage from the Cuyp in the
Dulwich Gallery, No. 163. It is merely wrought with a mechanical
play of brush in a well-trained hand, gradating the
color irregularly and agreeably, but with no more feeling or
knowledge of leafage than a paperstainer shows in graining a
pattern. A bit of the stalk is seen on the left; it might just
as well have been on the other side, for any connection the
leaves have with it. As the leafage retires into distance, the
Dutch painters merely diminish their <i>scale</i> of touch. The
touch itself remains the same, but its effect is falser; for though
the separate stains or blots in Fig. 2, do not rightly represent
the forms of leaves, they may not inaccurately represent the
number of leaves on that spray. But in distance, when, instead
of one spray, we have thousands in sight, no human industry,
nor possible diminution of touch can represent their mist of
foliage, and the Dutch work becomes doubly base, by reason of
false form, and lost infinity.</p>

<p>§ 8. Hence what I said in our first inquiry about foliage, &ldquo;A
single dusty roll of Turner&rsquo;s brush is more truly expressive of
the infinitude of foliage than the niggling of Hobbima could have
rendered his canvas, if he had worked on it till doomsday.&rdquo;
And this brings me to the main difficulty I have had in preparing
this section. That infinitude of Turner&rsquo;s execution attaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
not only to his distant work, but in due degree to the nearest
pieces of his trees. As I have shown in the chapter on mystery,
he perfected the system of art, as applicable to landscape, by
the introduction of this infiniteness. In other qualities he is
often only equal, in some inferior, to great preceding painters;
but in this mystery he stands alone. He could not paint a cluster
of leaves better than Titian; but he could a bough, much
more a distant mass of foliage. No man ever before painted a
distant tree rightly, or a full-leaved branch rightly. All Titian&rsquo;s
distant branches are ponderous flakes, as if covered with seaweed,
while Veronese&rsquo;s and Raphael&rsquo;s are conventional, being
exquisitely ornamental arrangements of small perfect leaves.
See the background of the Parnassus in Volpato&rsquo;s plate. It is
very lovely, however.</p>

<p>§ 9. But this peculiar execution of Turner&rsquo;s is entirely uncopiable;
least of all to be copied in engraving. It is at once so
dexterous and so keenly cunning, swiftest play of hand being
applied with concentrated attention on every movement, that no
care in facsimile will render it. The delay in the conclusion of
this work has been partly caused by the failure of repeated attempts
to express this execution. I see my way now to some
partial result; but must get the writing done, and give undivided
care to it before I attempt to produce costly plates. Meanwhile,
the little cluster of foliage opposite, from the thicket
which runs up the bank on the right-hand side of the drawing
of Richmond, looking up the river, in the Yorkshire series, will
give the reader some idea of the mingled definiteness and mystery
of Turner&rsquo;s work, as opposed to the mechanism of the
Dutch on the one side, and the conventional severity of the
Italians on the other. It should be compared with the published
engraving in the Yorkshire series; for just as much increase,
both in quantity and refinement, would be necessary in
every portion of the picture, before any true conception could
be given of the richness of Turner&rsquo;s designs. A fragment of
distant foliage I may give farther on; but, in order to judge
rightly of either example, we must know one or two points in
the structure of branches, requiring yet some irksome patience
of inquiry, which I am compelled to ask the reader to grant me
through another two chapters.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE BRANCH.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. We</span> have hitherto spoken of each shoot as either straight
or only warped by its spiral tendency; but no shoot of any
length, except those of the sapling, ever can be straight; for, as
the family of leaves which it bears are forced unanimously to
take some given direction in search of food or light, the stalk
necessarily obeys the same impulse, and bends itself so as to
sustain them in their adopted position, with the greatest ease to
itself and comfort for them.</p>

<p>In doing this, it has two main influences to comply or contend
with: the first, the direct action of the leaves in drawing it
this way or that, as they themselves seek particular situations;
the second, the pressure of their absolute weight after they have
taken their places, depressing each bough in a given degree; the
leverage increasing as the leaf extends. To these principal forces
may frequently be added that of some prevalent wind, which, on
a majority of days in the year, bends the bough, leaves and all,
for hours together, out of its normal position. Owing to these
three forces, the shoot is nearly sure to be curved in at least two
directions;<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> that is to say, not merely as the rim of a wine-glass
is curved (so that, looking at it horizontally, the circle becomes
a straight line), but as the edge of a lip or an eyebrow is curved,
partly upward, partly forwards, so that in no possible perspective
can it be seen as a straight line. Similarly, no perspective
will usually bring a shoot of a free-growing tree to appear a
straight line.</p>

<p>§ 2. It is evident that the more leaves the stalk has to sustain,
the more strength it requires. It might appear, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
not unadvisable, that every leaf should, as it grew, pay a small
tax to the stalk for its sustenance; so that there might be no fear
of any number of leaves being too oppressive to their bearer.
Which, accordingly, is just what the leaves do. Each, from the
moment of his complete majority, pays a stated tax to the stalk;
that is to say, collects for it a certain quantity of wood, or materials
for wood, and sends this wood, or what ultimately will become
wood, <i>down</i> the stalk to add to its thickness.</p>

<p>§ 3. &ldquo;Down the stalk?&rdquo; yes, and down a great way farther.
For, as the leaves, if they did not thus contribute to their own
support, would soon be too heavy for the spray, so if the spray,
with its family of leaves, contributed nothing to the thickness of
the branch, the leaf-families would soon break down their sustaining
branches. And, similarly, if the branches gave nothing
to the stem, the stem would soon fall under its boughs. Therefore,
by a power of which I believe no sufficient account exists,<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
as each leaf adds to the thickness of the shoot, so each shoot to
the branch, so each branch to the stem, and that with so perfect
an order and regularity of duty, that from every leaf in all the
countless crowd at the tree&rsquo;s summit, one slender fibre, or at least
fibre&rsquo;s thickness of wood, descends through shoot, through spray,
through branch, and through stem; and having thus added, in
its due proportion, to form the strength of the tree, labors yet
farther and more painfully to provide for its security; and
thrusting forward into the root, loses nothing of its mighty
energy, until, mining through the darkness, it has taken hold in
cleft of rock or depth of earth, as extended as the sweep of its
green crest in the free air.</p>

<p>§ 4. Such, at least, is the mechanical aspect of the tree. The
work of its construction, considered as a branch tower, partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
propped by buttresses, partly lashed by cables, is thus shared in
by every leaf. But considering it as a living body to be nourished,
it is probably an inaccurate analogy to speak of the leaves
being taxed for the enlargement of the trunk. Strictly speaking,
the trunk enlarges by sustaining them. For each leaf, however
far removed from the ground, stands in need of nourishment
derived from the ground, as well as of that which it finds in the
air; and it simply sends its root down along the stem of the
tree, until it reaches the ground and obtains the necessary mineral
elements. The trunk has been therefore called by some botanists
a &ldquo;bundle of roots,&rdquo; but I think inaccurately. It is rather a
messenger to the roots.<a name="fa3g" id="fa3g" href="#ft3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> A root, properly so called, is a fibre,
spongy or absorbent at the extremity, which secretes certain elements
from the earth. The stem is by this definition no more a
cluster of roots than a cluster of leaves, but a channel of intercourse
between the roots and the leaves. It can gather no nourishment.
It only carries nourishment, being, in fact, a group of
canals for the conveyance of marketable commodities, with an
electric telegraph attached to each, transmitting messages from
leaf to root, and root to leaf, up and down the tree. But whatever
view we take of the operative causes, the external and visible
fact is simply that every leaf does send down from its stalk a
slender thread of woody matter along the sides of the shoot it
grows upon; and that the increase of thickness in stem, proportioned
to the advance of the leaves, corresponds with an increase
of thickness in roots, proportioned to the advance of their outer
fibres. How far interchange of elements takes place between root
and leaf, it is not our work here to examine; the general and
broad idea is this, that the whole tree is fed partly by the earth,
partly by the air;&mdash;strengthened and sustained by the one, agitated
and educated by the other;&mdash;all of it which is best, in substance,
life, and beauty, being drawn more from the dew of heaven
than the fatness of the earth. The results of this nourishment
of the bough by the leaf in external aspect, are the object of our
immediate inquiry.</p>

<p>§ 5. Hitherto we have considered the shoot as an ascending
body, throwing off buds at intervals. This it is indeed; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
part of it which ascends is not seen externally. Look back to
Plate 51. You will observe that each shoot is furrowed, and
that the ridges between the furrows rise in slightly spiral lines,
terminating in the armlets under the buds which bore last year&rsquo;s
leaves. These ridges, which rib the shoot so distinctly, are not
on the ascending part of it. They are the contributions of each
successive leaf thrown out as it ascended. Every leaf sent down
a slender cord, covering and clinging to the shoot beneath, and
increasing its thickness. Each, according to his size and strength,
wove his little strand of cable, as a spider his thread; and cast it
down the side of the springing tower by a marvellous magic&mdash;irresistible!
The fall of a granite pyramid from an Alp may
perhaps be stayed; the descending force of that silver thread
shall not be stayed. It will split the rocks themselves at its
roots, if need be, rather than fail in its work.</p>

<p>So many leaves, so many silver cords. Count&mdash;for by just the
thickness of one cord, beneath each leaf, let fall in fivefold order
round and round, the shoot increases in thickness to its root:&mdash;a
spire built downwards from the heaven.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 225px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:175px; height:320px" src="images/img068.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 36.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>And now we see why the leaves dislike being above each
other. Each seeks a vacant place, where he
may freely let fall the cord. The turning aside
of the cable to avoid the buds beneath, is one of
the main causes of spiral curvature, as the shoot
increases. It required all the care I could give
to the drawing, and all Mr. Armytage&rsquo;s skill in
engraving Plate 51, to express, though drawing
them nearly of their full size, the principal
courses of curvature in even this least graceful
of trees.</p>

<p>§ 6. According to the structure thus ascertained,
the body of the shoot may at any point
be considered as formed by a central rod, represented by the
shaded inner circle, <i>a</i>, Fig. 36, surrounded by as many rods of
descending external wood as there are leaves above the point
where the section is made. The first five leaves above send down
the first dark rods; and the next above send down those between,
which, being from younger leaves, are less liable to interstices;
then the third group sending down the side, it will be seen at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
glance how a spiral action is produced. It would lead us into
too subtile detail, if I traced the forces of this spiral superimposition.
I must be content to let the reader peruse this part of
the subject for himself, if it amuses him, and lead to larger
questions.</p>

<p>§ 7. Broadly and practically, we may consider the whole
cluster of woody material in Fig. 36 as one circle of fibrous substance
formed round a small central rod. The real appearance
in most trees is approximately as in <i>b</i>, Fig. 36, the radiating
structure becoming more distinct in proportion to the largeness
and compactness of the wood.<a name="fa4g" id="fa4g" href="#ft4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:201px; height:257px" src="images/img069.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 37.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Now the next question is, how this descending external coating
of wood will behave itself when it comes to the forking of
the shoots. To simplify the examination of this, let us suppose
the original or growing shoot (whose section
is the shaded inner circle in Fig. 36) to
have been in the form of a letter Y, and no
thicker than a stout iron wire, as in Fig. 37.
Down the arms of this letter Y, we have
two fibrous streams running in the direction
of the arrows. If the depth or thickness of
these streams be such as at <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, what
will their thickness be when they unite at <i>e</i>?
Evidently, the quantity of wood surrounding
the vertical wire at <i>e</i> must be twice as great as that surrounding
the wires <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>§ 8. The reader will, perhaps, be good enough to take it on
my word (if he does not know enough of geometry to ascertain),
that the large circle, in Fig. 38, contains twice as much area as
either of the two smaller circles. Putting these circles in position,
so as to guide us, and supposing the trunk to be bounded
by straight lines, we have for the outline of the fork that in Fig.
38. How, then, do the two minor circles change into one large
one? The section of the stem at <i>a</i> is a circle; and at <i>b</i>, is a
circle; and at <i>c</i>, a circle. But what is it at <i>e</i>? Evidently, if
the two circles merely united gradually, without change of form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
through a series of figures, such as those at the top of Fig. 39,
the quantity of wood, instead of remaining the same, would
diminish from the contents of two circles to the contents of one.
So for every loss which the circles sustain at this junction, an
equal quantity of wood must be thrust out somehow to the side.
Thus, to enable the circles to run into each other, as far as shown
at <i>b</i>, in Fig. 39, there must be a loss between them of as much
wood as the shaded space. Therefore, half of that space must be
added, or rather pushed out on each side, and the section of the
uniting branch becomes approximately as in <i>c</i>, Fig. 39; the
wood squeezed out encompassing the stem more as the circles
close, until the whole is reconciled into one larger single circle.</p>

<p>§ 9. I fear the reader would have no patience with me, if I
asked him to examine, in longitudinal section, the lines of the
descending currents of wood as they eddy into the increased
single river. Of course, it is just what would take place if two
strong streams, filling each a cylindrical pipe, ran together into
one larger cylinder, with a central rod passing up every tube.
But, as this central rod increases, and, at the same time, the
supply of the stream from above, every added leaf contributing
its little current, the eddies of wood about the fork become intensely
curious and interesting; of which thus much the reader
may observe in a moment by gathering a branch of any tree
(laburnum shows it better, I think, than most), that the two
meeting currents, first wrinkling a little, then rise in a low wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
in the hollow of the fork, and flow over at the side, making their
way to diffuse themselves round the stem, as
in Fig. 40. Seen laterally, the bough bulges
out below the fork, rather curiously and awkwardly,
especially if more than two boughs
meet at the same place, growing in one plane,
so as to show the sudden increase on the profile.
If the reader is interested in the subject,
he will find strangely complicated and
wonderful arrangements of stream when
smaller boughs meet larger (one example is
given in Plate 3, Vol. III., where the current of a smaller bough,
entering upwards, pushes its way into the stronger rivers of the
stem). But I cannot, of course, enter into such detail here.</p>

<p>§ 10. The little ringed accumulation, repelled from the wood
of the larger trunk at the base of small boughs, may be seen at a
glance in any tree, and needs no illustration; but I give one
from Salvator, Fig. 41 (from his own etching, <i>Democritus omnium
Derisor</i>), which is interesting, because it shows the swelling
at the bases of insertion, which yet, Salvator&rsquo;s eye not being
quick enough to detect the law of descent in the fibres, he, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
his usual love of ugliness, fastens on this swollen character, and
exaggerates it into an appearance of disease. The same bloated
aspect may be seen in the example already given from another
etching, Vol. III., Plate 4, Fig. 8.</p>

<p>§ 11. I do not give any more examples from Claude. We
have had enough already in Plate 4, Vol. III., which the reader
should examine carefully. If he will then look forward to Fig.
61 here, he will see how Turner inserts branches, and with what
certain and strange instinct of fidelity he marks the wrinkled
enlargement and sinuous eddies of the wood rivers where they
meet.</p>

<p>And remember always that Turner&rsquo;s greatness and rightness
in all these points successively depend on no scientific knowledge.
He was entirely ignorant of all the laws we have been developing.
He had merely accustomed himself to see impartially, intensely,
and fearlessly.</p>

<p>§ 12. It may, perhaps, be interesting to compare, with the
rude fallacies of Claude and Salvator, a little piece of earliest
art, wrought by men who could see and feel. The scroll, Fig.
42, is a portion of that which surrounds the arch in San Zeno of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
Verona, above the pillar engraved in the <i>Stones of Venice</i>, Plate
17, Vol. I. It is, therefore, twelfth, or earliest thirteenth century
work. Yet the foliage is already full of spring and life; and
in the part of the stem, which I have given of its real size in Fig.
43, the reader will perhaps be surprised to see at the junctions
the laws of vegetation, which escaped the sight of all the degenerate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
landscape-painters of Italy, expressed by one of her simple
architectural workmen six hundred years ago.</p>

<p>We now know enough, I think, of the internal conditions
which regulate tree-structure to enable us to investigate finally,
the great laws of branch and stem aspect. But they are very
beautiful; and we will give them a separate chapter.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE STEM.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. We</span> must be content, in this most complex subject, to
advance very slowly: and our easiest, if not our only way, will
be to examine, first, the conditions under which boughs would
form, supposing them all to divide in one plane, as your hand
divides when you lay it flat on the table, with the fingers as wide
apart as you can. And then we will deduce the laws of ramification
which follow on the real structure of branches, which truly
divide, not in one plane, but as your fingers separate if you hold
a large round ball with them.</p>

<p>The reader has, I hope, a clear idea by this time of the main
principle of tree-growth; namely, that the increase is by addition,
or superimposition, not extension. A branch does not
stretch itself out as a leech stretches its body. But it receives
additions at its extremity, and proportional additions to its thickness.
For although the actual living shoot, or growing point, of
any year, lengthens itself gradually until it reaches its terminal
bud, after that bud is formed, its length is fixed. It is thenceforth
one joint of the tree, like the joint of a pillar, on which
other joints of marble may be laid to elongate the pillar, but
which will not itself stretch. A tree is thus truly edified, or
built, like a house.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 290px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:238px; height:359px" src="images/img076a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 44.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 2. I am not sure with what absolute stringency this law is
observed, or what slight lengthening of substance may be traceable
by close measurement among inferior branches. For practical
purposes, we may assume that the law is final, and that if
we represent the state of a plant, or extremity of branch, in any
given year under the simplest possible type, Fig. 44, <i>a</i>, of two
shoots, with terminal buds, springing from one stem, its growth
next year may be expressed by the type, Fig. 44, <i>b</i>, in which, the
original stems not changing or increasing, the terminal buds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
have built up each another story of plant, or repetition of the
original form; and, in order to support this new edifice, have
sent down roots all the way to the ground,
so as to enclose and thicken the inferior stem.</p>

<p>But if this is so, how does the original
stem, which never lengthens, ever become
the tall trunk of a tree? The arrangement
just stated provides very satisfactorily for
making it stout, but not for making it tall.
If the ramification proceeds in this way,
the tree must assuredly become a round
compact ball of short sticks, attached to the
ground by a very stout, almost invisible,
stem, like a puff-ball.</p>

<p>For if we take the form above, on a
small scale, merely to see what comes of it, and carry its branching
three steps farther, we get the successive conditions in Fig.
45, of which the last comes already round to the ground.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:759px; height:145px" src="images/img076b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 45.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>&ldquo;But those forms really look something like trees!&rdquo; Yes, if
they were on a large scale. But each of the little shoots is only
six or seven inches long; the whole cluster would but be three or
four feet over, and touches the ground already at its extremity.
It would enlarge if it went on growing, but never rise from the
ground.</p>

<p>§ 3. This is an interesting question: one, also, which, I fear,
we must solve, so far as yet it can be solved, with little help.
Perhaps nothing is more curious in the history of human mind
than the way in which the science of botany has become oppressed
by nomenclature. Here is perhaps the first question which an
intelligent child would think of asking about a tree: &ldquo;Mamma,
how does it make its trunk?&rdquo; and you may open one botanical
work after another, and good ones too, and by sensible men,&mdash;you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
shall not find this child&rsquo;s question fairly put, much less fairly
answered. You will be told gravely that a stem has received
many names, such as <i>culmus</i>, <i>stipes</i>, and <i>truncus</i>; that twigs
were once called <i>flagella</i>, but are now called <i>ramuli</i>; and that
Mr. Link calls a straight stem, with branches on its sides, a
<i>caulis excurrens</i>; and a stem, which at a certain distance above
the earth breaks out into irregular ramifications, a <i>caulis deliquescens</i>.
All thanks and honor be to Mr. Link! But at this
moment, when we want to know <i>why</i> one stem breaks &#8220;at a
certain distance,&rdquo; and the other not at all, we find no great help
in those splendid excurrencies and deliquescencies. &#8220;At a certain
distance?&rdquo; Yes: but why not before? or why then? How
was it that, for many and many a year, the young shoots agreed
to construct a vertical tower, or, at least, the nucleus of one, and
then, one merry day, changed their minds, and built about their
metropolis in all directions, nobody knows where, far into the air
in free delight? How is it that yonder larch-stem grows straight
and true, while all its branches, constructed by the same process
as the mother trunk, and under the mother trunk&rsquo;s careful inspection
and direction, nevertheless have lost all their manners,
and go forking and flashing about, more like cracklings of spitefullest
lightning than decent branches of trees that dip green
leaves in dew?</p>

<p>§ 4. We have probably, many of us, missed the point of such
questions as these, because we too readily associated the structure
of trees with that of flowers. The flowering part of a plant
shoots out or up, in some given direction, until, at a stated period,
it opens or branches into perfect form by a law just as fixed, and
just as inexplicable, as that which numbers the joints of an animal&rsquo;s
skeleton, and puts the head on its right joint. In many
forms of flowers&mdash;foxglove, aloe, hemlock, or blossom of maize&mdash;the
structure of the flowering part so far assimilates itself to that
of a tree, that we not unnaturally think of a tree only as a large
flower, or large remnant of flower, run to seed. And we suppose
the time and place of its branching to be just as organically determined
as the height of the stalk of straw, or hemlock pipe,
and the fashion of its branching just as fixed as the shape of
petals in a pansy or cowslip.</p>

<p>§ 5. But that is not so; not so in anywise. So far as you can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
watch a tree, it is produced throughout by repetitions of the same
process, which repetitions, however, are arbitrarily directed so as
to produce one effect at one time, and another at another time.
A young sapling has his branches as much as the tall tree. He
does not shoot up in a long thin rod, and begin to branch when
he is ten or fifteen feet high, as the hemlock or foxglove does
when each has reached its ten or fifteen inches. The young sapling
conducts himself with all the dignity of a tree from the first;&mdash;only
he so manages his branches as to form a support for his
future life, in a strong straight trunk, that will hold him well off
the ground. Prudent little sapling!&mdash;but how does he manage
this? how keep the young branches from rambling about, till the
proper time, or on what plea dismiss them from his service if
they will not help his provident purpose? So again, there is no
difference in mode of construction between the trunk of a pine
and its branch. But external circumstances so far interfere with
the results of this repeated construction, that a stone pine rises
for a hundred feet like a pillar, and then suddenly bursts into a
cloud. It is the knowledge of the mode in which such change
may take place which forms the true natural history of trees:&mdash;or,
more accurately, their moral history. An animal is born
with so many limbs, and a head of such a shape. That is, strictly
speaking, not its history, but one fact of its history: a fact of
which no other account can be given than that it was so appointed.
But a tree is born without a head. It has got to make its own
head. It is born like a little family from which a great nation
is to spring; and at a certain time, under peculiar external circumstances,
this nation, every individual of which remains the
same in nature and temper, yet gives itself a new political constitution,
and sends out branch colonies, which enforce forms of
law and life entirely different from those of the parent state.
That is the history of the state. It is also the history of a tree.</p>

<p>§ 6. Of these hidden histories, I know and can tell you as little
as I did of the making of rocks. It will be enough for me if
I can put the difficulty fairly before you, show you clearly such
facts as are necessary to the understanding of great Art, and so
leave you to pursue, at your pleasure, the graceful mystery of
this imperfect leafage life.</p>

<p>I took in the outset the type of a <i>triple</i> but as the most general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
that could be given of all trees, because it represents a prevalently
upright main tendency, with a capacity of branching on
both sides. I would have shown the power of branching on <i>all</i>
sides if I could; but we must be content at first with the simplest
condition. From what we have seen since of bud
structure, we may now make our type more complete
by giving each bud a root proportioned to its size. And
our elementary type of tree plant will be as in Fig. 46.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 150px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:84px; height:135px" src="images/img079.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 46.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 7. Now these three buds, though differently
placed, have all one mind. No bud has an oblique
mind. Every one would like, if he could, to grow upright,
and it is because the midmost one has entirely his own
way in this matter, that he is largest. He is an elder brother;&mdash;his
birthright is to grow straight towards the sky. A younger
child may perhaps supplant him, if he does not care for his
privilege. In the meantime all are of one family, and love each
other,&mdash;so that the two lateral buds do not stoop aside because
they like it, but to let their more favored brother grow in peace.
All the three buds and roots have at heart the same desire;&mdash;which
is, the one to grow as straight as he can towards bright heaven,
the other as deep as he can into dark earth. Up to light, and
down to shade;&mdash;into air and into rock:&mdash;that is their mind
and purpose for ever. So far as they can, in kindness to each
other, and by sufferance of external circumstances, work out that
destiny, they will. But their beauty will not result from their
working it out,&mdash;only from their maintained purpose and resolve
to do so, if it may be. They will fail&mdash;certainly two, perhaps all
three of them: fail egregiously;&mdash;ridiculously;&mdash;it may be agonizingly.
Instead of growing up, they may be wholly sacrificed to
happier buds above, and have to grow <i>down</i>, sideways, roundabout
ways, all sorts of ways. Instead of getting down quietly
into the convent of the earth, they may have to cling and crawl
about hardest and hottest angles of it, full in sight of man and
beast, and roughly trodden under foot by them;&mdash;stumbling-blocks
to many.</p>

<p>Yet out of such sacrifice, gracefully made&mdash;such misfortune,
gloriously sustained&mdash;all their true beauty is to arise. Yes, and
from more than sacrifice&mdash;more than misfortune: from <i>death</i>.
Yes, and more than death:&mdash;from the worst kind of death: not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
natural, coming to each in its due time; but premature, oppressed,
unnatural, misguided&mdash;or so it would seem&mdash;to the poor
dying sprays. Yet, without such death, no strong trunk were
ever possible; no grace of glorious limb or glittering leaf; no
companionship with the rest of nature or with man.</p>

<p>§ 8. Let us see how this must be. We return to our poor
little threefold type, Fig. 46, above. Next year he will become
as in Fig. 47. The two lateral buds keeping
as much as may be out of their brother&rsquo;s
way, and yet growing upwards with a will,
strike diagonal lines, and in moderate comfort
accomplish their year&rsquo;s life and terminal
buds. But what is to be done next?
Forming the triple terminal head on this
diagonal line, we find that one of our next
year&rsquo;s buds, <i>c</i>, will have to grow down again,
which is very hard; and another, <i>b</i>, will
run right against the lateral branch of the
upper bud, <span class="scs">A</span>, which must not be allowed
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>What are we to do?</p>

<p>§ 9. The best we can. Give up our straightness, and some
of our length, and consent to grow short, and crooked. But <i>b</i>
shall be ordered to stoop forward and keep his head out of the
great bough&rsquo;s way, as in Fig. 48, and grow as he best may, with
the consumptive pain in his chest. To give him a little more
room, the elder brother, <i>a</i>, shall stoop a little forward also, recovering
himself when he has got out of <i>b</i>&rsquo;s
way; and bud <i>c</i> shall be encouraged to
bend himself bravely round and up, after
his first start in that disagreeable downward
direction. Poor <i>b</i>, withdrawn from
air and light between <i>a</i> and <span class="scs">A</span>, and having
to live stooping besides, cannot make
much of himself, and is stunted and
feeble. <i>c</i>, having free play for his energies,
bends up with a will, and becomes handsomer, to our minds,
than if he had been straight; and <i>a</i> is none the worse for his concession
to unhappy <i>b</i> in early life.</p>

<p>So far well for this year. But how for next? <i>b</i> is already
too near the spray
above him, even for
his own strength and
comfort; much less,
with his weak constitution,
will he be able
to throw up any strong
new shoots. And if
he did, they would
only run into those of
the bough above. (If
the reader will proceed
in the construction of
the whole figure he will see that this is so.) Under these discouragements
and deficiencies, <i>b</i> is probably frostbitten, and
drops off. The bough proceeds, mutilated, and itself somewhat
discouraged. But it repeats its sincere and good-natured compliances,
and at the close of the year, new wood from all the leaves
having concealed the stump, and effaced the memory of poor lost
<i>b</i>, and perhaps a consolatory bud lower down having thrown out
a tiny spray to make the most of the vacant space near the main
stem, we shall find the bough in some such shape as Fig. 49.</p>

<p>§ 10. Wherein we already see the germ of our irregularly
bending branch, which might ultimately be much the prettier for
the loss of <i>b</i>. Alas! the Fates have forbidden even this. While
the low bough is making all these exertions, the boughs of <span class="scs">A</span>,
above him, higher in air, have made the same under happier
auspices. Every year their thicker leaves more and more forbid
the light; and, after rain, shed their own drops unwittingly on
the unfortunate lower bough, and prevent the air or sun from
drying his bark or checking the chill in his medullary rays.
Slowly a hopeless languor gains upon him. He buds here or
there, faintly, in the spring; but the flow of strong wood from
above oppresses him even about his root, where it joins the trunk.
The very sap does not turn aside to him, but rushes up to the
stronger, laughing leaves far above. Life is no more worth having;
and abandoning all effort, the poor bough drops, and finds
consummation of destiny in helping an old woman&rsquo;s fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span></p>

<p>When he is gone, the one next above is left with greater freedom,
and will shoot now from points of its sprays which were
before likely to perish. Hence another condition of irregularity
in form. But that bough also will fall in its turn, though after
longer persistence. Gradually thus the central trunk is built, and
the branches by whose help it was formed cast off, leaving here
and there scars, which are all effaced by years, or lost sight of
among the roughnesses and furrows of the aged surface. The
work is continually advancing, and thus the head of foliage on
any tree is not an expansion at a given height, like a flower-bell,
but the collective group of boughs, or workmen, who have got up
so far, and will get up higher next year, still losing one or two of
their number underneath.</p>

<p>§ 11. So far well. But this only accounts for the formation
of a vertical trunk. How is it that at a certain height this vertical
trunk ceases to be built; and irregular branches spread in
all directions?</p>

<p>First: In a great number of trees, the vertical trunk never
ceases to be built. It is confused, at the top of the tree, among
other radiating branches, being at first, of course, just as slender
as they, and only prevailing over them in time. It shows at the
top the same degree of irregularity and undulation as a sapling;
and is transformed gradually into straightness lower down (see
Fig. 50). The reader has only to take an hour&rsquo;s ramble, to see
for himself how many trees are thus constructed, if circumstances
are favorable to their growth. Again, the mystery of blossoming
has great influence in increasing the tendency to dispersion among
the upper boughs: but this part of vegetative structure I cannot
enter into; it is too subtle, and has, besides, no absolute bearing
on our subject; the principal conditions which produce the
varied play of branches being purely mechanical. The point at
which they show a determined tendency to spread is generally to
be conceived as a place of <i>rest</i> for the tree, where it has reached
the height from the ground at which ground-mist, imperfect circulation
of air, &amp;c., have ceased to operate injuriously on it, and
where it has free room, and air, and light for its growth.</p>

<p>§ 12. I find there is quite an infinite interest in watching the
different ways in which trees part their sprays at this resting-place,
and the sometimes abrupt, sometimes gentle and undiscoverable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
severing of the upright stem into the wandering and
wilful branches; but a volume, instead of a chapter or two, and
quite a little gallery of plates, would be needed to illustrate the
various grace of this division, associated as
it is with an exquisitely subtle effacing of
undulation in the thicker stems, by the
flowing down of the wood from above; the
curves which are too violent in the branches
being filled up, so that what was at <i>a</i>, Fig.
50, becomes as at <i>b</i>, and when the main
stem is old, passes at last into straightness
by almost imperceptible curves, a continually
gradated emphasis of curvature being carried to the branch
extremities.</p>

<p>§ 13. Hitherto we have confined ourselves entirely to examination
of stems in one plane. We must glance&mdash;though only to
ascertain how impossible it is to do more than glance&mdash;at the
conditions of form which result from the throwing out of
branches, not in one plane, but on all sides. &ldquo;As your fingers
divide when they hold a ball,&rdquo; I said: or,
better, a large cup, without a handle. Consider
how such ramification will appear in
one of the bud groups, that of our old friend
the oak. We saw it opened usually into five
shoots. Imagine, then (Fig. 51), a five-sided
cup or funnel with a stout rod running
through the centre of it. In the figure
it is seen from above, so as partly to show
the inside, and a little obliquely, that the
central rod may not hide any of the angles.
Then let us suppose that, where the angles
of this cup were, we have, instead, five
rods, as in Fig. 52, <span class="scs">A</span>, like the ribs of a
pentagonal umbrella turned inside out by
the wind. I dot the pentagon which connects
their extremities, to keep their positions clear. Then
these five rods, with the central one, will represent the five
shoots, and the leader, from a vigorous young oak-spray. Put
the leaves on each; the five-foiled star at its extremity, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
others, now not quite formally, but still on the whole as in Fig. 3
above, and we have the result, Fig. 52, <span class="scs">B</span>&mdash;rather a pretty one.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 52.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 14. By considering the various aspects which the five rods
would take in Fig. 52, as the entire group was seen from below
or above, and at different angles and distances, the reader may
find out for himself what changes of aspect are possible in even
so regular a structure as this. But the branchings soon take
more complex symmetry. We know that next year each of these
five subordinate rods is to enter into life on its own account, and
to repeat the branching of the first. Thus, we shall have five
pentagonal cups surrounding a large central pentagonal cup.
This figure, if the reader likes a pretty perspective problem, he
may construct for his own pleasure:&mdash;which having done, or
conceived, he is then to apply the great principles of subjection
and resilience, not to three branches only, as in Fig. 49, but to
the five of each cup;&mdash;by which the cups get flattened out and
bent up, as you may have seen vessels of Venetian glass, so that
every cup actually takes something the shape of a thick aloe or
artichoke leaf; and they surround the central one, not as a
bunch of grapes surrounds a grape at the end of it, but as the
petals grow round the centre of a rose. So that any one of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
lateral branches&mdash;though, seen from above, it would present a
symmetrical figure, as if it were not flattened (<span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 53)&mdash;seen
sideways, or in profile, will show itself to be at least as much
flattened as at <span class="scs">B</span>.</p>

<p>§ 15. You may thus regard the whole tree as composed of a
series of such thick, flat, branch-leaves; only incomparably more
varied and enriched in framework as they spread; and arranged
more or less in spirals round the trunk. Gather a cone of a
Scotch fir; begin at the bottom of it, and pull off the seeds, so
as to show one of the spiral rows of them continuously, from the
bottom to the top, leaving enough seeds above them to support
the row. Then the gradual lengthening of the seeds from the
root, their spiral arrangement, and their limitation within a
curved, convex form, furnish the best <i>severe</i> type you can have
of the branch system of all stemmed trees; and each seed of the
cone represents, not badly, the sort of flattened solid leaf-shape
which all complete branches have. Also, if you will try to draw
the spiral of the fir-cone, you will understand something about
tree-perspective, which may be generally useful. Finally, if
you note the way in which the seeds of the cone slip each farther
and farther over each other, so as to change sides in the middle
of the cone, and obtain a reversed action of spiral lines in the
upper half, you may imagine what a piece of work it would be
for both of us, if we were to try to follow the complexities of
branch order in trees of irregular growth, such as the rhododendron.
I tried to do it, at least, for the pine, in section, but saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
I was getting into a perfect maelström of spirals, from which no
efforts would have freed me, in any imaginable time, and the
only safe way was to keep wholly out of the stream.</p>

<p>§ 16. The alternate system, leading especially to the formation
of forked trees, is more manageable; and if the reader is
master of perspective, he may proceed some distance in the
examination of that for himself. But I do not care to frighten
the general reader by many diagrams: the book is always sure to
open at them when he takes it up. I will venture on one which
has perhaps something a little amusing about it, and is really of
importance.</p>

<p>§ 17. Let X, Fig. 54, represent a shoot of any opposite-leaved
tree. The mode in which it will grow into a tree depends,
mainly, on its disposition to lose the leader or a lateral shoot. If
it keeps the leader, but drops the lateral, it takes the form A,
and next year by a repetition of the process, B. But if it keeps
the laterals, and drops the leader, it becomes first, C and next
year, D. The form A is almost universal in spiral or alternate
trees; and it is especially to be noted as bringing about this
result, that in any given forking, one bough always goes on in
its own direct course, and the other leaves it softly; they do not
separate as if one was repelled from the other. Thus in Fig. 55,
a perfect and nearly symmetrical piece of ramification, by Turner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
(lowest bough but one in the tree on the left in the &ldquo;Château
of La belle Gabrielle&rdquo;), the leading bough, going on in its own
curve, throws off, first, a bough to the right, then one to the
left, then two small ones to the right, and proceeds itself, hidden
by leaves, to form the farthest upper point of the branch.</p>

<p>The lower secondary bough&mdash;the first thrown off&mdash;proceeds in
its own curve, branching first to the left, then to the right.</p>

<p>The upper bough proceeds in the same way, throwing off first
to left, then to right. And this is the commonest and most
graceful structure. But if the tree loses the leader, as at <span class="scs">C</span>, Fig.
54 (and many opposite trees have a trick of doing so), a very curious
result is arrived at, which I will give in a geometrical form.</p>

<p>§ 18. The number of branches which die, so as to leave the
main stem bare, is always greatest low down, or near the interior
of the tree. It follows that the lengths of stem which do not
fork diminish gradually to the extremities, in a fixed proportion.
This is a general law. Assume, for example&rsquo;s sake, the stem to
separate always into two branches, at an equal angle, and that
each branch is three quarters of the length of the preceding one.
Diminish their thickness in proportion, and carry out the figure
any extent you like. In Plate 56, opposite, Fig. 1, you have it
at its ninth branch; in which I wish you to notice, first, the delicate
curve formed by every complete line of the branches (compare
Vol. IV. Fig. 91); and, secondly, the very curious result of
the top of the tree being a broad flat line, which passes at an
angle into lateral shorter lines, and so down to the extremities.
It is this property which renders the contours of tops of trees so
intensely difficult to draw rightly, without making their curves
too smooth and insipid.</p>

<p>Observe, also, that the great weight of the foliage being
thrown on the outside of each main fork, the tendency of forked
trees is very often to droop and diminish the bough on one side,
and erect the other into a principal mass.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span></p>

<p>§ 19. But the form in a perfect tree is dependent on the revolution
of this sectional profile, so as to produce a mushroom-shaped
or cauliflower-shaped mass, of which I leave the reader
to enjoy the perspective drawing by himself, adding, after he has
completed it, the effect of the law of resilience to the extremities.
Only, he must note this: that in real trees, as the branches rise
from the ground, the open spaces underneath are partly filled by
subsequent branchings, so that a real tree has not so much the
shape of a mushroom, as of an apple, or, if elongated, a pear.</p>

<p>§ 20. And now you may just begin to understand a little of
Turner&rsquo;s meaning in those odd pear-shaped trees of his, in the
&ldquo;Mercury and Argus,&rdquo; and other such compositions: which,
however, before we can do completely, we must gather our evidence
together, and see what general results will come of it
respecting the hearts and fancies of trees, no less than their
forms.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1h" id="ft1h" href="#fa1h"><span class="fn">1</span></a> This is Harding&rsquo;s favorite form of tree. You will find it much insisted
on in his works on foliage. I intended to have given a figure to show
the results of the pressure of the weight of all the leafage on a great lateral
bough, in modifying its curves, the strength of timber being greatest where
the leverage of the mass tells most. But I find nobody ever reads things
which it takes any trouble to understand, so that it is of no use to write
them.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE LEAF MONUMENTS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. And</span> now, having ascertained in its main points the system
on which the leaf-workers build, let us see, finally, what
results in aspect, and appeal to human mind, their building must
present. In some sort it resembles that of the coral animal,
differing, however, in two points. First, the animal which forms
branched coral, builds, I believe, in calm water, and has few
accidents of current, light, or heat to contend with. He builds
in monotonous ramification, untormented, therefore unbeautiful.
Secondly, each coral animal builds for himself, adding his cell to
what has been before constructed, as a bee adds another cell to
the comb. He obtains no essential connection with the root and
foundation of the whole structure. That foundation is thickened
clumsily, by a fused and encumbering aggregation, as a stalactite
increases;&mdash;not by threads proceeding from the extremities to
the root.</p>

<p>§ 2. The leaf, as we have seen, builds in both respects under
opposite conditions. It leads a life of endurance, effort, and
various success, issuing in various beauty; and it connects
itself with the whole previous edifice by one sustaining thread,
continuing its appointed piece of work all the way from top to
root. Whence result three great conditions in branch aspect, for
which I cannot find good names, but must use the imperfect
ones of &ldquo;Spring,&rdquo; &ldquo;Caprice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fellowship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 3. I. <span class="sc">Spring</span>: or the appearance of elastic and progressive
power, as opposed to that look of a bent piece of cord.&mdash;This follows
partly on the poise of the bough, partly on its action in
seeking or shunning. Every branch-line expresses both these.
It takes a curve accurately showing the relations between the
strength of the sprays in that position (growing downward,
upward, or laterally), and the weight of leaves they carry; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
again, it takes a curve expressive of the will or aim of those
sprays, during all their life, and handed down from sire to son,
in steady inheritance of resolution to reach forward in a given
direction, or bend away from some given evil influence.</p>

<p>And all these proportionate strengths and measured efforts
of the bough produce its loveliness, and ought to be felt, in
looking at it, not by any mathematical evidence, but by the same
fine instinct which enables us to perceive, when a girl dances
rightly, that she moves easily, and with delight to herself; that
her limbs are strong enough, and her body tender enough, to
move precisely as she wills them to move. You cannot say of
any bend of arm or foot what precise relations of their curves
to the whole figure manifest, in their changeful melodies, that
ease of motion; yet you feel that they do so, and you feel it by
a true instinct. And if you reason on the matter farther, you
may know, though you cannot see, that an absolute mathematical
necessity proportions every bend of the body to the rate and
direction of its motion; and that the momentary fancy and fire
of the will measure themselves, even in their gaily-fancied freedom,
by stern laws of nervous life, and material attraction, which
regulate eternally every pulse of the strength of man, and every
sweep of the stars of heaven.</p>

<p>§ 4. Observe, also, the balance of the bough of a tree is quite
as subtle as that of a figure in motion. It is a balance between
the elasticity of the bough and the weight of leaves, affected in
curvature, literally, by the growth of <i>every</i> leaf; and besides
this, when it moves, it is partly supported by the resistance of
the air, greater or less, according to the shape of leaf;&mdash;so that
branches float on the wind more than they yield to it; and in
their tossing do not so much bend under a force, as rise on a
wave, which penetrates in liquid threads through all their sprays.</p>

<p>§ 5. I am not sure how far, by any illustration, I can exemplify
these subtle conditions of form. All my plans have been
shortened, and I have learned to content myself with yet more
contracted issues of them after the shortening, because I know
that nearly all in such matters must be said or shown, unavailably.
No saying will teach the truth. Nothing but doing. If
the reader will draw boughs of trees long and faithfully, giving
previous pains to gain the power (how rare!) of drawing <i>anything</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
faithfully, he will come to see what Turner&rsquo;s work is, or
any other right work, but not by reading, nor thinking, nor idly
looking. However, in some degree, even our ordinary instinctive
perception of grace and balance may serve us, if we choose
to pay any accurate attention to the matter.</p>

<p>§ 6. Look back to Fig. 55. That bough of Turner&rsquo;s is exactly
and exquisitely poised, leaves and all, for its present horizontal
position. Turn the book so as to put the spray upright,
with the leaves at the top. You ought to see they would then
be wrong;&mdash;that they must, in that position, have adjusted
themselves more directly above the main stem, and more firmly,
the curves of the lighter sprays being a deflection caused by their
weight in the horizontal position. Again, Fig. 56 represents,
enlarged to four times the size of the original, the two Scotch
firs in Turner&rsquo;s etching of Inverary.<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> These are both in perfect
poise, representing a double action: the warping of the trees
away from the sea-wind, and the continual growing out of the
boughs on the right-hand side, to recover the balance.</p>

<p>Turn the page so as to be horizontal, and you ought to feel
that, considered now as branches, both would be out of balance.
If you turn the heads of the trees to your right, they are wrong,
because gravity would have bent them more downwards; if to
your left, wrong, because the law of resilience would have raised
them more at the extremities.</p>

<p>§ 7. Now take two branches of Salvator&rsquo;s, Figs. 57 and 58.<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
You ought to feel that these have neither poise nor spring: their
leaves are incoherent, ragged, hanging together in decay.</p>

<p>Immediately after these, turn to Plate 57, opposite. The
branch at the top is facsimiled from that in the hand of Adam,
in Durer&rsquo;s Adam and Eve.<a name="fa3i" id="fa3i" href="#ft3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a> It is full of the most exquisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
vitality and spring in every line. Look at it for five minutes
carefully. Then turn back to Salvator&rsquo;s, Fig. 57. Are you as
well satisfied with it? You ought to feel that it is not strong
enough at the origin to sustain the leaves; and that if it were,
those leaves themselves are in broken or forced relations with
each other. Such relations might, indeed, exist in a partially
withered tree, and one of these branches is intended to be partially
withered, but the other is not; and if it were, Salvator&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
choice of the withered tree is precisely the sign of his preferring
ugliness to beauty, decrepitude and disorganization to life and
youth. The leaves on the spray, by Durer, hold themselves as
the girl holds herself in dancing; those on Salvator&rsquo;s as an old
man, partially palsied, totters along with broken motion, and
loose deflection of limb.</p>

<p>§ 8. Next, let us take a spray by Paul Veronese<a name="fa4i" id="fa4i" href="#ft4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;the lower
figure in Plate 57. It is just as if we had gathered one out of
the garden. Though every line and leaf in the quadruple group
is necessary to join with other parts of the composition of the
noble picture, every line and leaf is also as free and true as if it
were growing. None are confused, yet none are loose; all are
individual, yet none separate, in tender poise of pliant strength
and fair order of accomplished grace, each, by due force of the
indulgent bough, set and sustained.</p>

<p>§ 9. Observe, however, that in all these instances from earlier
masters, the expression of the universal botanical law of poise is
independent of accuracy in rendering of species. As before noticed,
the neglect of specific distinction long restrained the advance of
landscape, and even hindered Turner himself in many respects.
The sprays of Veronese are a conventional type of laurel;
Albert Durer&rsquo;s an imaginary branch of paradisaical vegetation;
Salvator&rsquo;s, a rude reminiscence of sweet chestnut; Turner&rsquo;s only
is a faithful rendering of the Scotch fir.</p>

<p>§ 10. To show how the principle of balance is carried out by
Nature herself, here is a little terminal upright spray of willow,
the most graceful of English trees (Fig. 59). I have drawn it
carefully; and if the reader will study its curves, or, better,
trace and pencil them with a perfectly fine point, he will feel, I
think, without difficulty, their finished relation to the leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
they sustain. Then if we turn suddenly to a piece of Dutch
branch-drawing (Fig. 60), facsimiled from No. 160, Dulwich
Gallery (Berghem), he will understand, I believe,
also the qualities of that, without comment
of mine. It is of course not so dark in
the original, being drawn with the chance
dashes of a brush loaded with brown, but the
contours are absolutely as in the woodcut.
This Dutch design is a very characteristic example
of two faults in tree-drawing; namely,
the loss not only of grace and spring, but of
woodiness. A branch is not elastic as steel is,
neither as a carter&rsquo;s whip is. It is a combination,
wholly peculiar, of elasticity with half-dead
and sapless stubbornness, and of continuous
curve with pauses of knottiness, every
bough having its blunted, affronted, fatigued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
or repentant moments of existence, and mingling crabbed rugosities
and fretful changes of mind with the main tendencies of its
growth. The piece of pollard willow opposite (Fig. 61), facsimiled
from Turner&rsquo;s etching of &ldquo;Young Anglers,&rdquo; in the Liber
Studiorum, has all these characters in perfectness, and may serve
for sufficient study of them. It is impossible to explain in what
the expression of the woody strength consists, unless it be felt.
One very obvious condition is the excessive fineness of curvature,
approximating continually to a straight line. In order to get
a piece of branch curvature given as accurately as I could by an
unprejudiced person, I set one of my pupils at the Working
Men&rsquo;s College (a joiner by trade) to draw, last spring, a lilac
branch of its real size, as it grew, before it budded. It was
about six feet long, and before he could get it quite right, the
buds came out and interrupted him; but the fragment he got
drawn is engraved in flat profile, in Plate 58. It has suffered
much by reduction, one or two of its finest curves having become
lost in the mere thickness of the lines. Nevertheless, if
the reader will compare it carefully with the Dutch work, it will
teach him something about trees.</p>

<p>§ 11. II. <span class="sc">Caprice.</span>&mdash;The next character we had to note of
the leaf-builders was their capriciousness, noted, partly, in Vol.
III. chap. ix. § 14. It is a character connected with the ruggedness
and ill-temperedness just spoken of, and an essential source
of branch beauty: being in reality the written story of all the
branch&rsquo;s life,&mdash;of the theories it formed, the accidents it suffered,
the fits of enthusiasm to which it yielded in certain delicious
warm springs; the disgusts at weeks of east wind, the mortifications
of itself for its friends&rsquo; sakes; or the sudden and successful
inventions of new ways of getting out to the sun. The reader
will understand this character in a moment, by merely comparing
Fig. 62, which is a branch of Salvator&rsquo;s,<a name="fa5i" id="fa5i" href="#ft5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a> with Fig. 63, which
I have traced from the engraving, in the Yorkshire series, of
Turner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aske Hall.&rdquo; You cannot but feel at once, not only
the wrongness of Salvator&rsquo;s, but its dulness. It is not now a
question either of poise, or grace, or gravity; only of wit. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
bough has got no sense; it has not been struck by a single new
idea from the beginning of it to the end; dares not even cross
itself with one of its own sprays. You will be amazed, in taking
up any of these old engravings, to see how seldom the boughs <i>do</i>
cross each other. Whereas, in nature, not only is the intersection
of extremities a mathematical necessity (see Plate 56), but
out of this intersection and crossing of curve by curve, and the
opposition of line it involves, the best part of their composition
arises. Look at the way the boughs are interwoven in that
piece of lilac stem (Plate 58).</p>

<p>§ 12. Again: As it seldom struck the old painters that boughs
must cross each other, so it never seems to have occurred to
them that they must be sometimes foreshortened. I chose this
bit from &ldquo;Aske Hall,&rdquo; that you might see at once, both how
Turner foreshortens the main stem, and how, in doing so, he
shows the turning aside, and outwards, of the one next to it, to
the left, to get more air.<a name="fa6i" id="fa6i" href="#ft6i"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Indeed, this foreshortening lies at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
the core of the business; for unless it be well understood, no
branch-form can ever be rightly drawn. I placed the oak spray
in Plate 51 so as to be seen as
nearly straight on its flank as
possible. It is the most uninteresting
position in which a
bough can be drawn; but it
shows the first simple action
of the law of resilience. I will
now turn the bough with its
extremity towards us, and foreshorten
it (Plate 59), which
being done, you perceive another
tendency in the whole
branch, not seen at all in the
first Plate, to throw its sprays
to its own right (or to your
left), which it does to avoid the
branch next it, while the <i>forward</i>
action is in a sweeping
curve round to your right, or
to the branch&rsquo;s left: a curve
which it takes to recover position
after its first concession.
The lines of the nearer and
smaller shoots are very nearly&mdash;thus
foreshortened&mdash;those of
a boat&rsquo;s bow. Here is a piece
of Dutch foreshortening for
you to compare with it, Fig.
64.<a name="fa7i" id="fa7i" href="#ft7i"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>§ 13. In this final perfection
of bough-drawing, Turner
stands <i>wholly alone</i>. Even Titian does not foreshorten his boughs
rightly. Of course he could, if he had cared to do so; for if you
can foreshorten a limb or a hand, much more a tree branch. But
either he had never looked at a tree carefully enough to feel that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
it was necessary, or, which is more likely, he disliked to introduce
in a background elements of vigorous projection. Be the reason
what it may, if you take Lefèvre&rsquo;s plates of the Peter Martyr and
St. Jerome&mdash;the only ones I know which give any idea of Titian&rsquo;s
tree-drawing, you will observe at once that the boughs lie in
flakes, artificially set to the right and left, and are not intricate
or varied, even where the foliage indicates some foreshortening;&mdash;completing
thus the evidence for my statement long ago given,
that no man but Turner had ever drawn the stem of a tree.</p>

<p>§ 14. It may be well also to note, for the advantage of the
general student of design, that, in foliage and bough drawing, all
the final grace and general utility of the study depend on its
being well foreshortened; and that, till the power of doing so
quite accurately is obtained, no landscape-drawing is of the least
value; nor can the character of any tree be known at all until
not only its branches, but its minutest extremities, have been
drawn in the severest foreshortening, with little accompanying
plans of the arrangements of the leaves or buds, or thorns, on the
stem. Thus Fig. 65 is the extremity of a single shoot of spruce
foreshortened, showing the resilience of its swords from
beneath, and Fig. 66 is a little ground-plan, showing the position
of the three lowest triple groups of thorn on a shoot of gooseberry.<a name="fa8i" id="fa8i" href="#ft8i"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
The fir shoot is carelessly drawn; but it is not worth
while to do it better, unless I engraved it on steel, so as to show
the fine relations of shade.</p>

<p>§ 15. III. <span class="sc">Fellowship.</span>&mdash;The compactness of mass presented
by this little sheaf of pine-swords may lead us to the consideration
of the last character I have to note of boughs; namely, the
mode of their association in masses. It follows, of course, from
all the laws of growth we have ascertained, that the terminal
outline of any tree or branch must be a simple one, containing
within it, at a given height or level, the series of leaves of the
year; only we have not yet noticed the kind of form which results,
in each branch, from the part it has to take in forming the mass
of the tree. The systems of branching are indeed infinite, and
could not be exemplified by any number of types; but here are two
common types, in section, which will enough explain what I mean.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:509px; height:608px" src="images/img111.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 67.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 16. If a tree branches with a concave tendency, it is apt to
carry its boughs to the outer curve of limitation, as at <span class="scs">A</span>, Fig. 67,
and if with a convex tendency, as at <span class="scs">B</span>. In either case the vertical
section, or profile, of a bough will give a triangular mass,
terminated by curves, and elongated at one extremity. These
triangular masses you may see at a glance, prevailing in the
branch system of any tree in winter. They may, of course, be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
mathematically reduced to the four types <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, Fig. 67,
but are capable of endless variety of expression in action, and in
the adjustment of their weights to the bearing stem.</p>

<p>§ 17. To conclude, then, we find that the beauty of these
buildings of the leaves consists, from the first step of it to the
last, in its showing their perfect fellowship; and a single aim
uniting them under circumstances of various distress, trial, and
pleasure. Without the fellowship, no beauty; without the steady
purpose, no beauty; without trouble, and death, no beauty; without
individual pleasure, freedom, and caprice, so far as may be
consistent with the universal good, no beauty.</p>

<p>§ 18. Tree-loveliness might be thus lost or killed in many
ways. Discordance would kill it&mdash;of one leaf with another; disobedience
would kill it&mdash;of any leaf to the ruling law; indulgence
would kill it, and the doing away with pain; or slavish
symmetry would kill it, and the doing away with
delight. And this is so, down to the smallest atom
and beginning of life: so soon as there is life at all,
there are these four conditions of it;&mdash;harmony,
obedience, distress, and delightsome inequality. Here
is the magnified section of an oak-bud, not the size
of a wheat grain (Fig. 68). Already its nascent leaves are seen
arranged under the perfect law of resilience, preparing for stoutest
work on the right side. Here is a dogwood bud just opening into
life (Fig. 69). Its ruling law
is to be four square, but see
how the uppermost leaf takes
the lead, and the lower bends
up, already a little distressed
by the effort. Here is a birch-bud,
farther advanced, Fig.
70. Who shall say how many
humors the little thing has
in its mind already; or how
many adventures it has passed
through? And so to the end.
Help, submission, sorrow,
dissimilarity, are the sources of all good;&mdash;war, disobedience,
luxury, equality, the sources of all evil.</p>

<p>§ 19. There is yet another and a deeply laid lesson to be
received from the leaf-builders, which I hope the reader has
already perceived. Every leaf, we have seen, connects its work
with the entire and accumulated result of the work of its predecessors.
Their previous construction served it during its life,
raised it towards the light, gave it more free sway and motion in
the wind, and removed it from the noxiousness of earth exhalation.
Dying, it leaves its own small but well-labored thread,
adding, though imperceptibly, yet essentially, to the strength,
from root to crest, of the trunk on which it had lived, and fitting
that trunk for better service to succeeding races of leaves.</p>

<p>We men, sometimes, in what we presume to be humility, compare
ourselves with leaves; but we have as yet no right to do so.
The leaves may well scorn the comparison. We who live for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
ourselves, and neither know how to use nor keep the work of past
time, may humbly learn,&mdash;as from the ant, foresight,&mdash;from the
leaf, reverence. The power of every great people, as of every
living tree, depends on its not effacing, but confirming and concluding,
the labors of its ancestors. Looking back to the history
of nations, we may date the beginning of their decline from
the moment when they ceased to be reverent in heart, and accumulative
in hand and brain; from the moment when the redundant
fruit of age hid in them the hollowness of heart, whence
the simplicities of custom and sinews of tradition had withered
away. Had men but guarded the righteous laws, and protected
the precious works of their fathers, with half the industry they
have given to change and to ravage, they would not now have
been seeking vainly, in millennial visions and mechanic servitudes,
the accomplishment of the promise made to them so long ago:
&ldquo;As the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect
shall long enjoy the work of their hands; they shall not labor in
vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the
blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 20. This lesson we have to take from the leaf&rsquo;s life. One
more we may receive from its death. If ever in autumn a pensiveness
falls upon us as the leaves drift by in their fading, may
we not wisely look up in hope to their mighty monuments? Behold
how fair, how far prolonged, in arch and aisle, the avenues
of the valleys; the fringes of the hills! So stately,&mdash;so eternal;
the joy of man, the comfort of all living creatures, the glory of
the earth,&mdash;they are but the monuments of those poor leaves that
flit faintly past us to die. Let them not pass, without our understanding
their last counsel and example: that we also, careless of
monument by the grave, may build it in the world&mdash;monument
by which men may be taught to remember, not where we died,
but where we lived.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. It</span> may be judged, by the time which it has taken to arrive
at any clear idea of the structure of shield-builders, what a
task would open to us if we endeavored to trace the more wonderful
forms of the wild builders with the sword. Not that they
are more complex; but they are more definite, and cannot be so
easily generalized. The conditions which produce the spire of the
cypress, and flaked breadth of the cedar, the rounded head of
the stone pine, and perfect pyramid of the black spruce, are far
more distinct, and would require more accurate and curious diagrams
to illustrate them, than the graceful, but in some degree
monotonous branching
of leaf-builders. In
broad principle they
are, however, alike.
The leaves construct
the sprays in the same
accumulative way: the
only essential difference
being that in the
sword-builders the
leaves are all set close,
and at equal intervals.
Instead of admitting
extended and variable
spaces between them,
the whole spray is one
tower of leaf-roots, set
in a perfect spiral. Thus, Fig. 71, at <span class="scs">A</span>, represents a fragment
of spray of Scotch fir of its real size. <span class="scs">B</span> is the same piece magnified,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
the diamond-like spaces being the points on which the
leaves grew. The dotted lines show the regularity of the spiral.
As the minor stems join in boughs, the scars left by the leaves
are gradually effaced, and a thick but broken and scaly bark
forms instead.</p>

<p>§ 2. A sword-builder may therefore be generally considered
as a shield-builder put under the severest military restraint.
The graceful and thin leaf is concentrated into a strong, narrow,
pointed rod; and the insertion of these rods on them is in a
close and perfectly timed order. In some ambiguous trees connected
with the tribe (as the arbor vitæ) there is no proper stem
to the outer leaves, but all the extremities form a kind of coralline
leaf, flat and fern-like, but articulated like a crustacean animal,
which gradually concentrates and embrowns itself into the
stem. The thicker branches of these trees are exquisitely fantastic;
and the mode in which the flat system of leaf first produces
an irregular branch, and then adapts itself to the symmetrical
cone of the whole tree, is one of the most interesting processes
of form which I know in vegetation.</p>

<p>§ 3. Neither this, however, nor any other of the pine formations,
have we space here to examine in detail; while without
detail, all discussion of them is in vain. I shall only permit myself
to note a few points respecting my favorite tree, the black
spruce, not with any view to art criticism (though we might get
at some curious results by a comparison of popular pine-drawing
in Germany, America, and other dark-wooded countries, with the
true natural forms), but because I think the expression of this
tree has not been rightly understood by travellers in Switzerland,
and that, with a little watching of it, they might easily obtain a
juster feeling.</p>

<p>§ 4. Of the many marked adaptations of nature to the mind
of man, it seems one of the most singular, that trees intended
especially for the adornment of the wildest mountains should be
in broad outline the most formal of trees. The vine, which is
to be the companion of man, is waywardly docile in its growth,
falling into festoons beside his cornfields, or roofing his garden-walks,
or casting its shadow all summer upon his door. Associated
always with the trimness of cultivation, it introduces all
possible elements of sweet wildness. The pine, placed nearly always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
among scenes disordered and desolate, brings into them all
possible elements of order and precision. Lowland trees may
lean to this side and that, though it is but a meadow breeze that
bends them, or a bank of cowslips from which their trunks lean
aslope. But let storm and avalanche do their worst, and let the
pine find only a ledge of vertical precipice to cling to, it will
nevertheless grow straight. Thrust a rod from its last shoot
down the stem;&mdash;it shall point to the centre of the earth as long
as the tree lives.</p>

<p>§ 5. Also it may be well for lowland branches to reach hither
and thither for what they need, and to take all kinds of irregular
shape and extension. But the pine is trained to need nothing,
and to endure everything. It is resolvedly whole, self-contained,
desiring nothing but rightness, content with restricted completion.
Tall or short, it will be straight. Small or large, it will
be round. It may be permitted also to these soft lowland trees
that they should make themselves gay with show of blossom, and
glad with pretty charities of fruitfulness. We builders with the
sword have harder work to do for man, and must do it in close-set
troops. To stay the sliding of the mountain snows, which
would bury him; to hold in divided drops, at our sword-points,
the rain, which would sweep away him and his treasure-fields;
to nurse in shade among our brown fallen leaves the tricklings
that feed the brooks in drought; to give massive shield against
the winter wind, which shrieks through the bare branches of the
plain:&mdash;such service must we do him steadfastly while we live.
Our bodies, also, are at his service: softer than the bodies of
other trees, though our toil is harder than theirs. Let him take
them as pleases him, for his houses and ships. So also it may
be well for these timid lowland trees to tremble with all their
leaves, or turn their paleness to the sky, if but a rush of rain
passes by them; or to let fall their leaves at last, sick and sere.
But we pines must live carelessly amidst the wrath of clouds.
We only wave our branches to and fro when the storm pleads
with us, as men toss their arms in a dream.</p>

<p>And finally, these weak lowland trees may struggle fondly for
the last remnants of life, and send up feeble saplings again from
their roots when they are cut down. But we builders with the
sword perish boldly; our dying shall be perfect and solemn, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
our warring: we give up our lives without reluctance, and for
ever.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>§ 6. I wish the reader to fix his attention for a moment on
these two great characters of the pine, its straightness and rounded
perfectness; both wonderful, and in their issue lovely, though
they have hitherto prevented the tree from being drawn. I say,
first, its straightness. Because we constantly see it in the wildest
scenery, we are apt to remember only as characteristic examples
of it those which have been disturbed by violent accident or disease.
Of course such instances are frequent. The soil of the
pine is subject to continual change; perhaps the rock in which
it is rooted splits in frost and falls forward, throwing the young
stems aslope, or the whole mass of earth around it is undermined
by rain, or a huge boulder falls on its stem from above, and forces
it for twenty years to grow with weight of a couple of tons leaning
on its side. Hence, especially at edges of loose cliffs, about
waterfalls, or at glacier banks, and in other places liable to disturbance,
the pine may be seen distorted and oblique; and in
Turner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Source of the Arveron,&rdquo; he has, with his usual unerring
perception of the main point in any matter, fastened on this
means of relating the glacier&rsquo;s history. The glacier cannot explain
its own motion; and ordinary observers saw in it only its
rigidity; but Turner saw that the wonderful thing was its non-rigidity.
Other ice is fixed, only this ice stirs. All the banks
are staggering beneath its waves, crumbling and withered as by
the blast of a perpetual storm. He made the rocks of his foreground
loose&mdash;rolling and tottering down together; the pines,
smitten aside by them, their tops dead, bared by the ice wind.</p>

<p>§ 7. Nevertheless, this is not the truest or universal expression
of the pine&rsquo;s character. I said long ago, even of Turner:
&ldquo;Into the spirit of the pine he cannot enter.&rdquo; He understood
the glacier at once; he had seen the force of sea on shore too
often to miss the action of those crystal-crested waves. But the
pine was strange to him, adverse to his delight in broad and flowing
line; he refused its magnificent erectness. Magnificent!&mdash;nay,
sometimes, almost terrible. Other trees, tufting crag or hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
yield to the form and sway of the ground, clothe it with soft
compliance, are partly its subjects, partly its flatterers, partly its
comforters. But the pine rises in serene resistance, self-contained;
nor can I ever without awe stay long under a great
Alpine cliff, far from all house or work of men, looking up to its
companies of pine, as they stand on the inaccessible juts and perilous
ledges of the enormous wall, in quiet multitudes, each like
the shadow of the one beside it&mdash;upright, fixed, spectral, as troops
of ghosts standing on the walls of Hades, not knowing each
other&mdash;dumb for ever. You cannot reach them, cannot cry to
them;&mdash;those trees never heard human voice; they are far above
all sound but of the winds. No foot ever stirred fallen leaf of
theirs. All comfortless they stand, between the two eternities of
the Vacancy and the Rock: yet with such iron will, that the rock
itself looks bent and shattered beside them&mdash;fragile, weak, inconsistent,
compared to their dark energy of delicate life, and
monotony of enchanted pride:&mdash;unnumbered, unconquerable.</p>

<p>§ 8. Then note, farther, their perfectness. The impression
on most people&rsquo;s minds must have been received more from pictures
than reality, so far as I can judge;&mdash;so ragged they think
the pine; whereas its chief character in health is green and full
roundness. It stands compact, like one of its own cones, slightly
curved on its sides, finished and quaint as a carved tree in some
Elizabethan garden; and instead of being wild in expression,
forms the softest of all forest scenery; for other trees show their
trunks and twisting boughs: but the pine, growing either in
luxuriant mass or in happy isolation, allows no branch to be seen.
Summit behind summit rise its pyramidal ranges, or down to the
very grass sweep the circlets of its boughs; so that there is nothing
but green cone and green carpet. Nor is it only softer, but
in one sense more cheerful than other foliage; for it casts only
a pyramidal shadow. Lowland forest arches overhead, and
chequers the ground with darkness; but the pine, growing in
scattered groups, leaves the glades between emerald-bright. Its
gloom is all its own; narrowing into the sky, it lets the sunshine
strike down to the dew. And if ever a superstitious feeling
comes over me among the pine-glades, it is never tainted with
the old German forest fear; but is only a more solemn tone of
the fairy enchantment that haunts our English meadows; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
that I have always called the prettiest pine glade in Chamouni,
&ldquo;Fairies&rsquo; Hollow.&rdquo; It is in the glen beneath the steep ascent
above Pont Pelissier, and may be reached by a little winding path
which goes down from the top of the hill; being, indeed, not
truly a glen, but a broad ledge of moss and turf, leaning in a formidable
precipice (which, however, the gentle branches hide)
over the Arve. An almost isolated rock promontory, many-colored,
rises at the end of it. On the other sides it is bordered by
cliffs, from which a little cascade falls, literally down among the
pines, for it is so light, shaking itself into mere showers of seed
pearl in the sun, that the pines don&rsquo;t know it from mist, and
grow through it without minding. Underneath, there is only
the mossy silence, and above, for ever, the snow of the nameless
Aiguille.</p>

<p>§ 9. And then the third character which I want you to notice
in the pine is its exquisite fineness. Other trees rise against the
sky in dots and knots, but this in fringes.<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> You never see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
edges of it, so subtle are they; and for this reason, it alone of
trees, so far as I know, is capable of the fiery change which we saw
before had been noticed by Shakespeare. When the sun rises behind
a ridge crested with pine, provided the ridge be at a distance
of about two miles, and seen clear, all the trees, for about
three or four degrees on each side of the sun, become trees of
light, seen in clear flame against the darker sky, and dazzling as
the sun itself. I thought at first this was owing to the actual
lustre of the leaves; but I believe now it is caused by the cloud-dew
upon them,&mdash;every minutest leaf carrying its diamond. It
seems as if these trees, living always among the clouds, had
caught part of their glory from them; and themselves the darkest
of vegetation, could yet add splendor to the sun itself.</p>

<p>§ 10. Yet I have been more struck by their character of finished
delicacy at a distance from the central Alps, among the
pastoral hills of the Emmenthal, or lowland districts of Berne,
where they are set in groups between the cottages, whose shingle
roofs (they also of pine) of deep gray blue, and lightly carved
fronts, golden and orange in the autumn sunshine,<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> gleam on
the banks and lawns of hill-side,&mdash;endless lawns, mounded, and
studded, and bossed all over with deeper green hay-heaps, orderly
set, like jewellery (the mountain hay, when the pastures are full
of springs, being strangely dark and fresh in verdure for a whole
day after it is cut). And amidst this delicate delight of cottage
and field, the young pines stand delicatest of all, scented as with
frankincense, their slender stems straight as arrows, and crystal
white, looking as if they would break with a touch, like needles;
and their arabesques of dark leaf pierced through and through
by the pale radiance of clear sky, opal blue, where they follow
each other along the soft hill-ridges, up and down.</p>

<p>§ 11. I have watched them in such scenes with the deeper
interest, because of all trees they have hitherto had most influence
on human character. The effect of other vegetation, however
great, has been divided by mingled species; elm and oak in
England, poplar in France, birch in Scotland, olive in Italy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
Spain, share their power with inferior trees, and with all the
changing charm of successive agriculture. But the tremendous
unity of the pine absorbs and moulds the life of a race. The
pine shadows rest upon a nation. The Northern peoples, century
after century, lived under one or other of the two great powers
of the Pine and the Sea, both infinite. They dwelt amidst the
forests, as they wandered on the waves, and saw no end, nor any
other horizon;&mdash;still the dark green trees, or the dark green
waters, jagged the dawn with their fringe, or their foam. And
whatever elements of imagination, or of warrior strength, or of
domestic justice, were brought down by the Norwegian and the
Goth against the dissoluteness or degradation of the South of
Europe, were taught them under the green roofs and wild penetralia
of the pine.</p>

<p>§ 12. I do not attempt, delightful as the task would be, to
trace this influence (mixed with superstition) in Scandinavia, or
North Germany; but let us at least note it in the instance which
we speak of so frequently, yet so seldom take to heart. There
has been much dispute respecting the character of the Swiss,
arising out of the difficulty which other nations had to understand
their simplicity. They were assumed to be either romantically
virtuous, or basely mercenary, when in fact they were
neither heroic nor base, but were true-hearted men, stubborn
with more than any recorded stubbornness; not much regarding
their lives, yet not casting them causelessly away; forming no
high ideal of improvement, but never relaxing their grasp of a
good they had once gained; devoid of all romantic sentiment,
yet loving with a practical and patient love that neither wearied
nor forsook; little given to enthusiasm in religion, but maintaining
their faith in a purity which no worldliness deadened and no
hypocrisy soiled; neither chivalrously generous nor pathetically
humane, yet never pursuing their defeated enemies, nor suffering
their poor to perish: proud, yet not allowing their pride to prick
them into unwary or unworthy quarrel; avaricious, yet contentedly
rendering to their neighbor his due; dull, but clear-sighted
to all the principles of justice; and patient, without ever allowing
delay to be prolonged by sloth, or forbearance by fear.</p>

<p>§ 13. This temper of Swiss mind, while it animated the whole
confederacy, was rooted chiefly in one small district which formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
the heart of their country, yet lay not among its highest mountains.
Beneath the glaciers of Zermatt and Evolena, and on the
scorching slopes of the Valais, the peasants remained in an aimless
torpor, unheard of but as the obedient vassals of the great
Bishopric of Sion. But where the lower ledges of calcareous rock
were broken by the inlets of the Lake Lucerne, and bracing winds
penetrating from the north forbade the growth of the vine, compelling
the peasantry to adopt an entirely pastoral life, was reared
another race of men. Their narrow domain should be marked
by a small green spot on every map of Europe. It is about forty
miles from east to west; as many from north to south: yet on
that shred of rugged ground, while every kingdom of the world
around it rose or fell in fatal change, and every multitudinous
race mingled or wasted itself in various dispersion and decline,
the simple shepherd dynasty remained changeless. There is no
record of their origin. They are neither Goths, Burgundians,
Romans, nor Germans. They have been for ever Helvetii, and
for ever free. Voluntarily placing themselves under the protection
of the House of Hapsburg, they acknowledged its supremacy,
but resisted its oppression; and rose against the unjust governors
it appointed over them, not to gain, but to redeem, their liberties.
Victorious in the struggle by the Lake of Egeri, they stood
the foremost standard-bearers among the nations of Europe in
the cause of loyalty and life&mdash;loyalty in its highest sense, to the
laws of God&rsquo;s helpful justice, and of man&rsquo;s faithful and brotherly
fortitude.</p>

<p>§ 14. You will find among them, as I said, no subtle wit nor
high enthusiasm, only an undeceivable common sense, and an
obstinate rectitude. They cannot be persuaded into their duties,
but they feel them; they use no phrases of friendship, but do
not fail you at your need. Questions of creed, which other nations
sought to solve by logic or reverie, these shepherds brought
to practical tests: sustained with tranquillity the excommunication
of abbots who wanted to feed their cattle on other people&rsquo;s
fields, and, halbert in hand, struck down the Swiss Reformation,
because the Evangelicals of Zurich refused to send them their due
supplies of salt. Not readily yielding to the demands of superstition,
they were patient under those of economy; they would purchase
the remission of taxes, but not of sins; and while the sale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
of indulgences was arrested in the church of Ensiedlen as boldly
as at the gates of Wittenberg, the inhabitants of the valley of
Frütigen<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> ate no meat for seven years, in order peacefully to free
themselves and their descendants from the seigniorial claims of
the Baron of Thurm.</p>

<p>§ 15. What praise may be justly due to this modest and rational
virtue, we have perhaps no sufficient grounds for defining.
It must long remain questionable how far the vices of superior
civilization may be atoned for by its achievements, and the errors
of more transcendental devotion forgiven to its rapture. But,
take it for what we may, the character of this peasantry is, at
least, serviceable to others and sufficient for their own peace;
and in its consistency and simplicity, it stands alone in the history
of the human heart. How far it was developed by circumstances
of natural phenomena may also be disputed; nor should
I enter into such dispute with any strongly held conviction. The
Swiss have certainly no feelings respecting their mountains in
anywise correspondent to ours. It was rather as fortresses of defence,
than as spectacles of splendor, that the cliffs of the Rothstock
bare rule over the destinies of those who dwelt at their feet;
and the training for which the mountain children had to thank
the slopes of the Muotta-Thal, was in soundness of breath, and
steadiness of limb, far more than in elevation of idea. But the
point which I desire the reader to note is, that the character of
the scene which, if any, appears to have been impressive to the
inhabitant, is not that which we ourselves feel when we enter the
district. It was not from their lakes, nor their cliffs, nor their
glaciers&mdash;though these were all peculiarly their possession, that
the three venerable cantons or states received their name. They
were not called the States of the Rock, nor the States of the Lake,
but the States of the <i>Forest</i>. And the one of the three which contains
the most touching record of the spiritual power of Swiss religion,
in the name of the convent of the &ldquo;Hill of Angels,&rdquo; has,
for its own, none but the sweet childish name of &ldquo;Under the
Woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 16. And indeed you may pass under them if, leaving the
most sacred spot in Swiss history, the Meadow of the Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
Fountains, you bid the boatman row southward a little way by
the shore of the Bay of Uri. Steepest there on its western side,
the walls of its rocks ascend to heaven. Far, in the blue of evening,
like a great cathedral pavement, lies the lake in its darkness;
and you may hear the whisper of innumerable falling waters
return from the hollows of the cliff, like the voices of a multitude
praying under their breath. From time to time the beat of a
wave, slow lifted, where the rocks lean over the black depth,
dies heavily as the last note of a requiem. Opposite, green with
steep grass, and set with chalet villages, the Fron-Alp rises in
one solemn glow of pastoral light and peace; and above, against
the clouds of twilight, ghostly on the gray precipice, stand,
myriad by myriad, the shadowy armies of the Unterwalden
pine.<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>I have seen that it is possible for the stranger to pass through
this great chapel, with its font of waters, and mountain pillars,
and vaults of cloud, without being touched by one noble thought,
or stirred by any sacred passion; but for those who received from
its waves the baptism of their youth, and learned beneath its
rocks the fidelity of their manhood, and watched amidst its
clouds the likeness of the dream of life, with the eyes of age&mdash;for
these I will not believe that the mountain shrine was built, or
the calm of its forest-shadows guarded by their God, in vain.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="center chap2">LEAVES MOTIONLESS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. It</span> will be remembered that our final inquiry was to be
into the sources of beauty in the tented plants, or flowers of the
field; which the reader may perhaps suppose one of no great difficulty,
the beauty of flowers being somewhat generally admitted
and comprehended.</p>

<p>Admitted? yes. Comprehended? no; and, which is worse,
in all its highest characters, for many a day yet, incomprehensible:
though with a little steady application, I suppose we might
soon know more than we do now about the colors of flowers,&mdash;being
tangible enough, and staying longer than those of clouds.
We have discovered something definite about colors of opal and
of peacock&rsquo;s plume; perhaps, also, in due time we may give some
account of that true gold (the only gold of intrinsic value) which
gilds buttercups; and understand how the spots are laid, in painting
a pansy.</p>

<p>Art is of interest, when we may win any of its secrets; but to
such knowledge the road lies not up brick streets. And howsoever
that flower-painting may be done, one thing is certain, it is
not by machinery.</p>

<p>§ 2. Perhaps, it may be thought, if we understood flowers
better, we might love them less.</p>

<p>We do not love them much, as it is. Few people care about
flowers. Many, indeed, are fond of finding a new shape of blossom,
caring for it as a child cares about a kaleidoscope. Many,
also, like a fair service of flowers in the greenhouse, as a fair service
of plate on the table. Many are scientifically interested in
them, though even these in the nomenclature rather than the
flowers. And a few enjoy their gardens; but I have never heard
of a piece of land, which would let well on a building lease, remaining
unlet because it was a flowery piece. I have never heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
of parks being kept for wild hyacinths, though often of their
being kept for wild beasts. And the blossoming time of the
year being principally spring, I perceive it to be the mind of
most people, during that period, to stay in towns.</p>

<p>§ 3. A year or two ago, a keen-sighted and eccentrically-minded
friend of mine, having taken it into his head to violate
this national custom, and go to the Tyrol in spring, was passing
through a valley near Landech, with several similarly headstrong
companions. A strange mountain appeared in the distance,
belted about its breast with a zone of blue, like our English
Queen. Was it a blue cloud? A blue horizontal bar of the air
that Titian breathed in youth, seen now far away, which mortal
might never breathe again? Was it a mirage&mdash;a meteor? Would it
stay to be approached? (ten miles of winding road yet between
them and the foot of its mountain.) Such questioning had they
concerning it. My keen-sighted friend alone maintained it to be
substantial: whatever it might be, it was not air, and would not
vanish. The ten miles of road were overpassed, the carriage left,
the mountain climbed. It stayed patiently, expanding still into
richer breadth and heavenlier glow&mdash;a belt of gentians. Such
things may verily be seen among the Alps in spring, and in spring
only. Which being so, I observe most people prefer going in
autumn.</p>

<p>§ 4. Nevertheless, without any special affection for them,
most of us, at least, languidly consent to the beauty of flowers,
and occasionally gather them, and prefer them from among other
forms of vegetation. This, strange to say, is precisely what great
painters do <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>Every other kind of object they paint, in its due place and
office, with respect;&mdash;but, except compulsorily and imperfectly,
never flowers. A curious fact, this! Here are men whose lives
are spent in the study of color, and the one thing they will not
paint is a flower! Anything but that. A furred mantle, a jewelled
zone, a silken gown, a brazen corslet, nay, an old leathern
chair, or a wall-paper if you will, with utmost care and delight;&mdash;but
a flower by no manner of means, if avoidable. When the
thing has perforce to be done, the great painters of course do it
rightly. Titian, in his early work, sometimes carries a blossom
or two out with affection, as the columbines in our Bacchus and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
Ariadne. So also Holbein. But in his later and mightier work,
Titian will only paint a fan or a wristband intensely, never a
flower. In his portrait of Lavinia, at Berlin, the roses are just
touched finely enough to fill their place, with no affection whatever,
and with the most subdued red possible; while in the later
portrait of her, at Dresden, there are no roses at all, but a belt of
chased golden balls, on every stud of which Titian has concentrated
his strength, and I verily believe forgot the face a little,
so much has his mind been set on them.</p>

<p>§ 5. In Paul Veronese&rsquo;s Europa, at Dresden, the entire foreground
is covered with flowers, but they are executed with sharp
and crude touches like those of a decorative painter. In Correggio&rsquo;s
paintings, at Dresden, and in the Antiope of the Louvre,
there are lovely pieces of foliage, but no flowers. A large garland
of oranges and lemons, with their leaves, above the St.
George, at Dresden, is connected traditionally with the garlanded
backgrounds of Ghirlandajo and Mantegna, but the studious absence
of flowers renders it almost disagreeably ponderous. I do
not remember any painted by Velasquez, or by Tintoret, except
compulsory Annunciation lilies. The flowers of Rubens are gross
and rude; those of Vandyck vague, slight, and subdued in color,
so as not to contend with the flesh. In his portraits of King
Charles&rsquo;s children, at Turin, an enchanting picture, there is a
rose-thicket, in which the roses seem to be enchanted the wrong
way, for their leaves are all gray, and the flowers dull brick-red.
Yet it is right.</p>

<p>§ 6. One reason for this is that all great men like their inferior
forms to follow and obey contours of large surfaces, or
group themselves in connected masses. Patterns do the first,
leaves the last; but flowers stand separately.</p>

<p>Another reason is that the beauty of flower-petals and texture
can only be seen by looking at it close; but flat patterns can be
seen far off, as well as gleaming of metal-work. All the great
men calculate their work for effect at some distance, and with
that object, know it to be lost time to complete the drawing of
flowers. Farther, the forms of flowers being determined, require
a painful attention, and restrain the fancy; whereas, in painting
fur, jewels, or bronze, the color and touch may be varied almost
at pleasure, and without effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span></p>

<p>Again, much of what is best in flowers is inimitable in painting;
and a thoroughly good workman feels the feebleness of his
means when he matches them fairly with Nature, and gives up
the attempt frankly&mdash;painting the rose dull red, rather than trying
to rival its flush in sunshine.</p>

<p>And, lastly, in nearly all good landscape-painting, the breadth
of foreground included implies such a distance of the spectator
from the nearest object as must entirely prevent his seeing flower
detail.</p>

<p>§ 7. There is, however, a deeper reason than all these; namely,
that flowers have no sublimity. We shall have to examine the
nature of sublimity in our following and last section, among other
ideas of relation. Here I only note the fact briefly, that impressions
of awe and sorrow being at the root of the sensation of sublimity,
and the beauty of separate flowers not being of the kind
which connects itself with such sensation, there is a wide distinction,
in general, between flower-loving minds and minds of the
highest order. Flowers seem intended for the solace of ordinary
humanity: children love them; quiet, tender, contented ordinary
people love them as they grow; luxurious and disorderly
people rejoice in them gathered: They are the cottager&rsquo;s treasure;
and in the crowded town, mark, as with a little broken
fragment of rainbow, the windows of the workers in whose heart
rests the covenant of peace. Passionate or religious minds contemplate
them with fond, feverish intensity; the affection is seen
severely calm in the works of many old religious painters, and
mixed with more open and true country sentiment in those of
our own pre-Raphaelites. To the child and the girl, the peasant
and the manufacturing operative, to the grisette and the nun, the
lover and monk, they are precious always. But to the men of
supreme power and thoughtfulness, precious only at times; symbolically
and pathetically often to the poets, but rarely for their
own sake. They fall forgotten from the great workmen&rsquo;s and
soldiers&rsquo; hands. Such men will take, in thankfulness, crowns of
leaves, or crowns of thorns&mdash;not crowns of flowers.</p>

<p>§ 8. Some beautiful things have been done lately, and more
beautiful are likely to be done, by our younger painters, in representing
blossoms of the orchard and the field in mass and
extent. I have had something to do with the encouragement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
this impulse; and truly, if pictures are to be essentially imitative
rather than inventive, it is better to spend care in painting
hyacinths than dead leaves, and roses rather than stubble. Such
work, however, as I stated in my first essay on this subject, in
the year 1851,<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> can only connect itself with the great schools by
becoming inventive instead of copyist; and for the most part, I
believe these young painters would do well to remember that the
best beauty of flowers being wholly inimitable, and their sweetest
service unrenderable by art, the picture involves some approach
to an unsatisfying mockery, in the cold imagery of what Nature
has given to be breathed with the profuse winds of spring, and
touched by the happy footsteps of youth.</p>

<p>§ 9. Among the greater masters, as I have said, there is little
laborious or affectionate flower-painting. The utmost that Turner
ever allows in his foregrounds is a water-lily or two, a cluster
of heath or foxglove, a thistle sometimes, a violet or daisy,
or a bindweed-bell; just enough to lead the eye into the understanding
of the rich mystery of his more distant leafage. Rich
mystery, indeed, respecting which these following facts about the
foliage of tented plants must be noted carefully.</p>

<p>§ 10. Two characters seem especially aimed at by Nature in
the earth-plants: first, that they should be characteristic and
interesting; secondly, that they should not be very visibly
injured by crushing.</p>

<p>I say, first, characteristic. The leaves of large trees take
approximately simple forms, slightly monotonous. They are
intended to be seen in mass. But the leaves of the herbage at our
feet take all kinds of strange shapes, as if to invite us to examine
them. Star-shaped, heart-shaped, spear-shaped, arrow-shaped,
fretted, fringed, cleft, furrowed, serrated, sinuated; in whorls,
in tufts, in spires, in wreaths endlessly expressive, deceptive,
fantastic, never the same from footstalk to blossom; they seem
perpetually to tempt our watchfulness, and take delight in outstripping
our wonder.</p>

<p>§ 11. Secondly, observe, their forms are such as will not be
visibly injured by crushing. Their complexity is already disordered:
jags and rents are their laws of being; rent by the footstep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
they betray no harm. Here, for instance (Fig. 72), is the
mere outline of a buttercup-leaf in full free growth; which, perhaps,
may be taken as a good common type of earth foliage. Fig.
73 is a less advanced one, placed so as to show its symmetrical
bounding form. But both, how various;&mdash;how delicately rent
into beauty! As in the aiguilles of the great Alps, so in this
lowest field-herb, where rending is the law of being, it is the law
of loveliness.</p>

<p>§ 12. One class, however, of these torn leaves, peculiar to
the tented plants, has, it seems to me, a strange expressional
function. I mean the group of leaves rent into <i>alternate</i> gaps,
typically represented by the thistle. The alternation of the rent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
if not absolutely, is effectively, peculiar to the earth-plants.
Leaves of the builders are rent symmetrically, so as to form radiating
groups, as in the horse-chestnut, or they are irregularly
sinuous, as in the oak; but the earth-plants continually present
forms such as those in the opposite Plate: a kind of web-footed
leaf, so to speak; a continuous tissue, enlarged alternately on
each side of the stalk. Leaves of this form have necessarily a
kind of limping gait, as if they grew not all at once, but first a
little bit on one side, and then a little bit on the other, and
wherever they occur in quantity, give the expression to foreground
vegetation which we feel and call &ldquo;ragged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 13. It is strange that the mere alternation of the rent
should give this effect; the more so, because alternate leaves,
completely separate from each other, produce one of the most
graceful types of building plants. Yet the fact is indeed so, that
the alternate rent in the earth-leaf is the principal cause of its
ragged effect. However deeply it may be rent symmetrically, as
in the alchemilla, or buttercup, just instanced, and however
finely divided, as in the parsleys, the result is always a delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
richness, unless the jags are alternate, and the leaf-tissue continuous
at the stem; and the moment these conditions appear,
so does the raggedness.</p>

<p>§ 14. It is yet more worthy of note that the proper duty of
these leaves, which catch the eye so clearly and powerfully,
would appear to be to draw the attention of man to spots where
his work is needed, for they nearly all habitually grow on ruins
or neglected ground: not noble ruins, or on <i>wild</i> ground, but
on heaps of rubbish, or pieces of land which have been indolently
cultivated or much disturbed. The leaf on the right of
the three in the Plate, which is the most characteristic of the
class, is that of the Sisymbrium Irio, which grows, by choice,
always on ruins left by fire. The plant, which, as far as I have
observed, grows first on earth that has been moved, is the colts-foot:
its broad covering leaf is much jagged, but only irregular,
not alternate in the rent; but the weeds that mark habitual neglect,
such as the thistle, give clear alternation.</p>

<p>§ 15. The aspects of complexity and carelessness of injury are
farther increased in the herb of the field, because it is &ldquo;herb
yielding seed;&rdquo; that is to say, a seed different in character from
that which trees form in their fruit.</p>

<p>I am somewhat alarmed in reading over the above sentence,
lest a botanist, or other scientific person, should open the book
at it. For of course the essential character of either fruit or
seed being only that in the smallest compass the vital principle
of the plant is rendered portable, and for some time, preservable,
we ought to call every such vegetable dormitory a &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;seed&rdquo; indifferently. But with respect to man there is a notable
difference between them.</p>

<p>A seed is what we &ldquo;sow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fruit, what we &ldquo;enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fruit is seed prepared especially for the sight and taste of
man and animals; and in this sense we have true fruit and traitorous
fruit (poisonous); but it is perhaps the best available distinction,<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
that seed being the part necessary for the renewed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
birth of the plant, a fruit is such seed enclosed or sustained by
some extraneous substance, which is soft and juicy, and beautifully
colored, pleasing and useful to animals and men.</p>

<p>§ 16. I find it convenient in this volume, and wish I had
thought of the expedient before, whenever I get into a difficulty,
to leave the reader to work it out. He will perhaps, therefore,
be so good as to define fruit for himself. Having defined it, he
will find that the sentence about which I was alarmed above is,
in the main, true, and that tented plants principally are herb
yielding seed, while building plants give fruit. The berried shrubs
of rock and wood, however dwarfed in stature, are true builders.
The strawberry-plant is the only important exception&mdash;a tender
Bedouin.</p>

<p>§ 17. Of course the principal reason for this is the plain,
practical one, that fruit should not be trampled on, and had
better perhaps be put a little out of easy reach than too near the
hand, so that it may not be gathered wantonly or without some
little trouble, and may be waited for until it is properly ripe:
while the plants meant to be trampled on have small and multitudinous
seed, hard and wooden, which may be shaken and
scattered about without harm.</p>

<p>Also, fine fruit is often only to be brought forth with patience;
not by young and hurried trees&mdash;but in due time, after
much suffering; and the best fruit is often to be an adornment
of old age, so as to supply the want of other grace. While the
plants which will not work, but only bloom and wander, do not
(except the grasses) bring forth fruit of high service, but only
the seed that prolongs their race, the grasses alone having great
honor put on them for their humility, as we saw in our first
account of them.</p>

<p>§ 18. This being so, we find another element of very complex
effect added to the others which exist in tented plants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
namely, that of minute, granular, feathery, or downy seed-vessels,
mingling quaint brown punctuation, and dusty tremors of
dancing grain, with the bloom of the nearer fields; and casting
a gossamered grayness and softness of plumy mist along their
surfaces far away; mysterious evermore, not only with dew in
the morning or mirage at noon, but with the shaking threads of
fine arborescence, each a little belfry of grain-bells, all a-chime.</p>

<p>§ 19. I feel sorely tempted to draw one of these same spires
of the fine grasses, with its sweet changing proportions of pendent
grain, but it would be a useless piece of finesse, as such form
of course never enters into general foreground effect.<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> I have,
however, engraved, at the top of the group of woodcuts opposite
(Fig. 74), a single leaf cluster of Durer&rsquo;s foreground in the
St. Hubert, which is interesting in several ways; as an example
of modern work, no less than old; for it is a facsimile twice
removed; being first drawn from the plate with the pen, by
Mr. Allen, and then facsimiled on wood by Miss Byfield; and
if the reader can compare it with the original, he will find it still
come tolerably close in most parts (though the nearest large leaf
has got spoiled), and of course some of the finest and most precious
qualities of Durer&rsquo;s work are lost. Still, it gives a fair idea
of his perfectness of conception, every leaf being thoroughly set
in perspective, and drawn with unerring decision. On each side
of it (Figs. 75, 76) are two pieces from a fairly good modern
etching, which I oppose to the Durer in order to show the difference
between true work and that which pretends to give detail,
but is without feeling or knowledge. There are a great many
leaves in the piece on the left, but they are all set the same way;
the draughtsman has not conceived their real positions, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
draws one after another as he would deliver a tale of bricks.
The grasses on the right look delicate, but are a mere series of
inorganic lines. Look how Durer&rsquo;s grass-blades cross each other.
If you take a pen and copy a little piece of each example, you
will soon feel the difference. Underneath, in the centre (Fig.
77), is a piece of grass out of Landseer&rsquo;s etching of the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo;
Pets,&rdquo; more massive and effective than the two lateral fragments,
but still loose and uncomposed. Then underneath is a piece of
firm and good work again, which will stand with Durer&rsquo;s; it is
the outline only of a group of leaves out of Turner&rsquo;s foreground
in the Richmond from the Moors, of which I give a reduced
etching, Plate 61, for the sake of the foreground principally, and
in Plate 62, the group of leaves in question, in their light and
shade, with the bridge beyond. What I have chiefly to say
of them belongs to our section on composition; but this mere
fragment of a Turner foreground may perhaps lead the reader to
take note in his great pictures of the almost inconceivable labor
with which he has sought to express the redundance and delicacy
of ground leafage.</p>

<p>§ 20. By comparing the etching in Plate 61 with the published
engraving, it will be seen how much yet remains to be
done before any approximately just representation of Turner
foreground can be put within the reach of the public. This
Plate has been reduced by Mr. Armytage from a pen-drawing of
mine, as large as the original of Turner&rsquo;s (18 inches by 11 inches).
It will look a little better under a magnifying glass; but only a
most costly engraving, of the real size, could give any idea of
the richness of mossy and ferny leafage included in the real
design. And if this be so on one of the ordinary England drawings
of a barren Yorkshire moor, it may be imagined what the
task would be of engraving truly such a foreground as that of
the &ldquo;Bay of Baiæ&rdquo; or &ldquo;Daphne and Leucippus,&rdquo; in which
Turner&rsquo;s aim has been luxuriance.</p>

<p>§ 21. His mind recurred, in all these classical foregrounds,
to strong impressions made upon him during his studies at
Rome, by the masses of vegetation which enrich its heaps of
ruin with their embroidery and bloom. I have always partly
regretted these Roman studies, thinking that they led him into
too great fondness of pandering luxuriance in vegetation, associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
with decay; and prevented his giving affection enough to
the more solemn and more sacred infinity with which, among the
mightier ruins of the Alpine Rome, glow the pure and motionless
splendors of the gentian and the rose.</p>

<p>§ 22. Leaves motionless. The strong pines wave above them,
and the weak grasses tremble beside them; but the blue stars
rest upon the earth with a peace as of heaven; and far along
the ridges of iron rock, moveless as they, the rubied crests of
Alpine rose flush in the low rays of morning. Nor these yet the
stillest leaves. Others there are subdued to a deeper quietness,
the mute slaves of the earth, to whom we owe, perhaps, thanks,
and tenderness, the most profound of all we have to render for
the leaf ministries.</p>

<p>§ 23. It is strange to think of the gradually diminished
power and withdrawn freedom among the orders of leaves&mdash;from
the sweep of the chestnut and gadding of the vine, down to the
close shrinking trefoil, and contented daisy, pressed on earth;
and, at last, to the leaves that are not merely close to earth, but
themselves a part of it; fastened down to it by their sides, here
and there only a wrinkled edge rising from the granite crystals.
We have found beauty in the tree yielding fruit, and in the
herb yielding seed. How of the herb yielding <i>no</i> seed,<a name="fa4k" id="fa4k" href="#ft4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a> the
fruitless, flowerless lichen of the rock?</p>

<p>§ 24. Lichen, and mosses (though these last in their luxuriance
are deep and rich as herbage, yet both for the most part
humblest of the green things that live),&mdash;how of these? Meek
creatures! the first mercy of the earth, veiling with hushed
softness its dintless rocks; creatures full of pity, covering with
strange and tender honor the scarred disgrace of ruin,&mdash;laying
quiet finger on the trembling stones, to teach them rest. No
words, that I know of, will say what these mosses are. None
are delicate enough, none perfect enough, none rich enough.
How is one to tell of the rounded bosses of furred and beaming
green,&mdash;the starred divisions of rubied bloom, fine-filmed, as if
the Rock Spirits could spin porphyry as we do glass,&mdash;the traceries
of intricate silver, and fringes of amber, lustrous, arborescent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
burnished through every fibre into fitful brightness and
glossy traverses of silken change, yet all subdued and pensive,
and framed for simplest, sweetest offices of grace. They will
not be gathered, like the flowers, for chaplet or love-token; but
of these the wild bird will make its nest, and the wearied child
his pillow.</p>

<p>And, as the earth&rsquo;s first mercy, so they are its last gift to us.
When all other service is vain, from plant and tree, the soft
mosses and gray lichen take up their watch by the head-stone.
The woods, the blossoms, the gift-bearing grasses, have done
their parts for a time, but these do service for ever. Trees for
the builder&rsquo;s yard, flowers for the bride&rsquo;s chamber, corn for the
granary, moss for the grave.</p>

<p>§ 25. Yet as in one sense the humblest, in another they are
the most honored of the earth-children. Unfading, as motionless,
the worm frets them not, and the autumn wastes not.
Strong in lowliness, they neither blanch in heat nor pine in frost.
To them, slow-fingered, constant-hearted, is entrusted the weaving
of the dark, eternal, tapestries of the hills; to them, slow-pencilled,
iris-dyed, the tender framing of their endless imagery.
Sharing the stillness of the unimpassioned rock, they share also
its endurance; and while the winds of departing spring scatter
the white hawthorn blossom like drifted snow, and summer dims
on the parched meadow the drooping of its cowslip-gold,&mdash;far
above, among the mountains, the silver lichen-spots rest, star-like,
on the stone; and the gathering orange stain upon the edge
of yonder western peak reflects the sunsets of a thousand years.</p>

<p><a name="ft1k" id="ft1k" href="#fa1k"><span class="fn">1</span></a> <i>Pre-Raphaelitism.</i> The essay contains some important notes on Turner&rsquo;s
work, which, therefore, I do not repeat in this volume.</p>

<p><a name="ft2k" id="ft2k" href="#fa2k"><span class="fn">2</span></a> I say the &ldquo;best available distinction.&rdquo; It is, of course, no real distinction.
A peapod is a kind of central type of seed and seed-vessel, and it is
difficult so to define fruit as to keep clear of it. Pea-shells are boiled and
eaten in some countries rather than pease. It does not sound like a scientific
distinction to say that fruit is a &ldquo;shell which is good without being
boiled.&rdquo; Nay, even if we humiliate ourselves into this practical reference
to the kitchen, we are still far from success. For the pulp of a strawberry
is not a &ldquo;shell,&rdquo; the seeds being on the outside of it. The available
part of a pomegranate or orange, though a seed envelope, is itself shut
within a less useful rind. While in an almond the shell becomes less profitable
still, and all goodness retires into the seed itself, as in a grain of corn.</p>

<p><a name="ft3k" id="ft3k" href="#fa3k"><span class="fn">3</span></a> For the same reason, I enter into no considerations respecting the geometrical
forms of flowers, though they are deeply interesting, and perhaps
some day I may give a few studies of them separately. The reader should
note, however, that beauty of form in flowers is chiefly dependent on a more
accurately finished or more studiously varied development of the tre-foil,
quatre-foil, and cinq-foil structures which we have seen irregularly approached
by leaf-buds. The most beautiful six-foiled flowers (like the
rhododendron-shoot) are composed of two triangular groups, one superimposed
on the other, as in the narcissus; and the most interesting types both
of six-foils and cinq-foils are unequally leaved, symmetrical on opposite
sides, as the iris and violet.</p>

<p><a name="ft4k" id="ft4k" href="#fa4k"><span class="fn">4</span></a> The reader must remember always that my work is concerning the
<i>aspects</i> of things only. Of course, a lichen has seeds, just as other plants
have, but not effectually or visibly for man.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE CLOUD-BALANCINGS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. We</span> have seen that when the earth had to be prepared
for the habitation of man, a veil, as it were, of intermediate
being was spread between him and its darkness, in which were
joined, in a subdued measure, the stability and insensibility of
the earth, and the passion and perishing of mankind.</p>

<p>But the heavens, also, had to be prepared for his habitation.</p>

<p>Between their burning light,&mdash;their deep vacuity, and man,
as between the earth&rsquo;s gloom of iron substance, and man, a veil
had to be spread of intermediate being;&mdash;which should appease
the unendurable glory to the level of human feebleness, and sign
the changeless motion of the heavens with a semblance of human
vicissitude.</p>

<p>Between earth and man arose the leaf. Between the heaven
and man came the cloud. His life being partly as the falling
leaf, and partly as the flying vapor.</p>

<p>§ 2. Has the reader any distinct idea of what clouds are?
We had some talk about them long ago, and perhaps thought
their nature, though at that time not clear to us, would be easily
enough understandable when we put ourselves seriously to make
it out. Shall we begin with one or two easiest questions?</p>

<p>That mist which lies in the morning so softly in the valley,
level and white, through which the tops of the trees rise as if
through an inundation&mdash;why is <i>it</i> so heavy? and why does it lie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
so low, being yet so thin and frail that it will melt away utterly
into splendor of morning, when the sun has shone on it but a
few moments more? Those colossal pyramids, huge and firm,
with outlines as of rocks, and strength to bear the beating of the
high sun full on their fiery flanks&mdash;why are <i>they</i> so light,&mdash;their
bases high over our heads, high over the heads of Alps? why
will these melt away, not as the sun rises, but as he descends,
and leave the stars of twilight clear, while the valley vapor gains
again upon the earth like a shroud?</p>

<p>Or that ghost of a cloud, which steals by yonder clump of
pines; nay, which does <i>not</i> steal by them, but haunts them,
wreathing yet round them, and yet&mdash;and yet, slowly: now falling
in a fair waved line like a woman&rsquo;s veil; now fading, now
gone: we look away for an instant, and look back, and it is
again there. What has it to do with that clump of pines, that
it broods by them and weaves itself among their branches, to and
fro? Has it hidden a cloudy treasure among the moss at their
roots, which it watches thus? Or has some strong enchanter
charmed it into fond returning, or bound it fast within those
bars of bough? And yonder filmy crescent, bent like an archer&rsquo;s
bow above the snowy summit, the highest of all the hill,&mdash;that
white arch which never forms but over the supreme crest,&mdash;how
is it stayed there, repelled apparently from the snow&mdash;nowhere
touching it, the clear sky seen between it and the mountain edge,
yet never leaving it&mdash;poised as a white bird hovers over its nest?</p>

<p>Or those war-clouds that gather on the horizon, dragon-crested,
tongued with fire;&mdash;how is their barbed strength bridled?
what bits are these they are champing with their vaporous
lips; flinging off flakes of black foam? Leagued leviathans of
the Sea of Heaven, out of their nostrils goeth smoke, and their
eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. The sword of him
that layeth at them cannot hold the spear, the dart, nor the
habergeon. Where ride the captains of their armies? Where
are set the measures of their march? Fierce murmurers, answering
each other from morning until evening&mdash;what rebuke is
this which has awed them into peace? what hand has reined
them back by the way by which they came?</p>

<p>§ 3. I know not if the reader will think at first that questions
like these are easily answered. So far from it, I rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
believe that some of the mysteries of the clouds never will be
understood by us at all. &ldquo;Knowest thou the balancings of the
clouds?&rdquo; Is the answer ever to be one of pride? &ldquo;The wondrous
works of Him which is perfect in knowledge?&rdquo; Is <i>our</i>
knowledge ever to be so?</p>

<p>It is one of the most discouraging consequences of the varied
character of this work of mine, that I am wholly unable to take
note of the advance of modern science. What has conclusively
been discovered or observed about clouds, I know not; but by
the chance inquiry possible to me I find no book which fairly
states the difficulties of accounting for even the ordinary aspects
of the sky. I shall, therefore, be able in this section to
do little more than suggest inquiries to the reader, putting the
subject in a clear form for him. All men accustomed to investigation
will confirm me in saying that it is a great step when we
are personally quite certain what we do <i>not</i> know.</p>

<p>§ 4. First, then, I believe we do not know what makes clouds
float. Clouds are water, in some fine form or another; but
water is heavier than air, and the finest form you can give a
heavy thing will not make it float in a light thing. <i>On</i> it, yes;
as a boat: but <i>in</i> it, no. Clouds are not boats, nor boat-shaped,
and they float in the air, not on the top of it. &ldquo;Nay, but
though unlike boats, may they not be like feathers? If out of
quill substance there may be constructed eider-down, and out of
vegetable tissue, thistle-down, both buoyant enough for a time,
surely of water-tissue may be constructed also water-down, which
will be buoyant enough for all cloudy purposes.&rdquo; Not so.
Throw out your eider plumage in a calm day, and it will all come
settling to the ground: slowly indeed, to aspect; but practically
so fast that all our finest clouds would be here in a heap about
our ears in an hour or two, if they were only made of water-feathers.
&ldquo;But may they not be quill-feathers, and have air
inside them? May not all their particles be minute little balloons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A balloon only floats when the air inside it is either specifically,
or by heating, lighter than the air it floats in. If the
cloud-feathers had warm air inside their quills, a cloud would
be warmer than the air about it, which it is not (I believe).
And if the cloud-feathers had hydrogen inside their quills, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
cloud would be unwholesome for breathing, which it is not&mdash;at
least so it seems to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But may they not have nothing inside their quills?&rdquo; Then
they would rise, as bubbles do through water, just as certainly as,
if they were solid feathers, they would fall. All our clouds
would go up to the top of the air, and swim in eddies of cloud-foam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is not that just what they do?&rdquo; No. They float at
different heights, and with definite forms, in the body of the air
itself. If they rose like foam, the sky on a cloudy day would
look like a very large flat glass of champagne seen from below,
with a stream of bubbles (or clouds) going up as fast as they
could to a flat foam-ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But may they not be just so nicely mixed out of something
and nothing, as to float where they are wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes: that is just what they not only may, but must be: only
this way of mixing something and nothing is the very thing I
want to explain or have explained, and cannot do it, nor get it
done.</p>

<p>§ 5. Except thus far. It is conceivable that minute hollow
spherical globules might be formed of water, in which the enclosed
vacuity just balanced the weight of the enclosing water,
and that the arched sphere formed by the watery film was strong
enough to prevent the pressure of the atmosphere from breaking
it in. Such a globule would float like a balloon at the height in
the atmosphere where the equipoise between the vacuum it enclosed,
and its own excess of weight above that of the air, was
exact. It would, probably, approach its companion globules by
reciprocal attraction, and form aggregations which might be
visible.</p>

<p>This is, I believe, the view usually taken by meteorologists.
I state it as a possibility, to be taken into account in examining
the question&mdash;a possibility confirmed by the scriptural words
which I have taken for the title of this chapter.</p>

<p>§ 6. Nevertheless, I state it as a possibility only, not seeing
how any known operation of physical law could explain the formation
of such molecules. This, however, is not the only difficulty.
Whatever shape the water is thrown into, it seems at
first improbable that it should lose its property of wetness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
Minute division of rain, as in &ldquo;Scotch mist,&rdquo; makes it capable
of floating farther,<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> or floating up and down a little, just as dust
will float, though pebbles will not; or gold-leaf, though a sovereign
will not; but minutely divided rain wets as much as any
other kind, whereas a cloud, partially always, sometimes entirely,
loses its power of moistening. Some low clouds look, when you
are in them, as if they were made of specks of dust, like short
hairs; and these clouds are entirely dry. And also many clouds
will wet some substances, but not others. So that we must grant
farther, if we are to be happy in our theory, that the spherical
molecules are held together by an attraction which prevents their
adhering to any foreign body, or perhaps ceases only under some
peculiar electric conditions.</p>

<p>§ 7. The question remains, even supposing their production
accounted for,&mdash;What intermediate states of water may exist between
these spherical hollow molecules and pure vapor?</p>

<p>Has the reader ever considered the relations of commonest
forms of volatile substance? The invisible particles which cause
the scent of a rose-leaf, how minute, how multitudinous, passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
richly away into the air continually! The visible cloud
of frankincense&mdash;why visible? Is it in consequence of the
greater quantity, or larger size of the particles, and how does
the heat act in throwing them off in this quantity, or of this
size?</p>

<p>Ask the same questions respecting water. It dries, that is,
becomes volatile, invisibly, at (any?) temperature. Snow dries,
as water does. Under increase of heat, it volatilizes faster, so as
to become dimly visible in large mass, as a heat-haze. It reaches
boiling point, then becomes entirely visible. But compress it,
so that no air shall get between the watery particles&mdash;it is invisible
again. At the first issuing from the steam-pipe the steam is
transparent; but opaque, or visible, as it diffuses itself. The
water is indeed closer, because cooler, in that diffusion; but
more air is between its particles. Then this very question of
visibility is an endless one, wavering between form of substance
and action of light. The clearest (or least visible) stream becomes
brightly opaque by more minute division in its foam, and
the clearest dew in hoar-frost. Dust, unperceived in shade, becomes
constantly visible in sunbeam; and watery vapor in the
atmosphere, which is itself opaque, when there is promise of
fine weather, becomes exquisitely transparent; and (questionably)
blue, when it is going to rain.</p>

<p>§ 8. Questionably blue: for besides knowing very little about
water, we know what, except by courtesy, must, I think, be
called Nothing&mdash;about air. Is it the watery vapor, or the air
itself, which is blue? Are neither blue, but only white, producing
blue when seen over dark spaces? If either blue, or white,
why, when crimson is their commanded dress, are the most distant
clouds crimsonest? Clouds close to us may be blue, but
far off, golden,&mdash;a strange result, if the air is blue. And again,
if blue, why are rays that come through large spaces of it red;
and that Alp, or anything else that catches far-away light, why
colored red at dawn and sunset? No one knows, I believe. It
is true that many substances, as opal, are blue, or green, by reflected
light, yellow by transmitted; but air, if blue at all, is
blue always by transmitted light. I hear of a wonderful solution
of nettles, or other unlovely herb, which is green when
shallow,&mdash;red when deep. Perhaps some day, as the motion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
the heavenly bodies by help of an apple, their light by help of a
nettle, may be explained to mankind.</p>

<p>§ 9. But farther: these questions of volatility, and visibility,
and hue, are all complicated with those of shape. How is a cloud
outlined? Granted whatever you choose to ask, concerning its
material, or its aspect, its loftiness and luminousness,&mdash;how of its
limitation? What hews it into a heap, or spins it into a web?
Cold is usually shapeless, I suppose, extending over large spaces
equally, or with gradual diminution. You cannot have, in the
open air, angles, and wedges, and coils, and cliffs of cold. Yet
the vapor stops suddenly, sharp and steep as a rock, or thrusts
itself across the gates of heaven in likeness of a brazen bar; or
braids itself in and out, and across and across, like a tissue of
tapestry; or falls into ripples, like sand; or into waving shreds
and tongues, as fire. On what anvils and wheels is the vapor
pointed, twisted, hammered, whirled, as the potter&rsquo;s clay? By
what hands is the incense of the sea built up into domes of
marble?</p>

<p>And, lastly, all these questions respecting substance, and aspect,
and shape, and line, and division, are involved with others
as inscrutable, concerning action. The curves in which clouds
move are unknown;&mdash;nay, the very method of their motion, or
apparent motion, how far it is by change of place, how far by appearance
in one place and vanishing from another. And these
questions about movement lead partly far away into high mathematics,
where I cannot follow them, and partly into theories concerning
electricity and infinite space, where I suppose at present
no one can follow them.</p>

<p>What, then, is the use of asking the questions?</p>

<p>For my own part, I enjoy the mystery, and perhaps the reader
may. I think he ought. He should not be less grateful for summer
rain, or see less beauty in the clouds of morning, because
they come to prove him with hard questions; to which, perhaps,
if we look close at the heavenly scroll,<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> we may find also a syllable
or two of answer illuminated here and there.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1l" id="ft1l" href="#fa1l"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The buoyancy of solid bodies of a given specific gravity, in a given
fluid, depends, first on their size, then on their forms.</p>

<p>First, on their size; that is to say, on the proportion of the magnitude
of the object (irrespective of the distribution of its particles) to the magnitude
of the particles of the air.</p>

<p>Thus, a grain of sand is buoyant in wind, but a large stone is not; and
pebbles and sand are buoyant in water in proportion to their smallness, fine
dust taking long to sink, while a large stone sinks at once. Thus, we see
that water may be arranged in drops of any magnitude, from the largest
rain-drop, about the size of a large pea, to an atom so small as not to be
separately visible, the smallest rain passing gradually into mist. Of these
drops of different sizes (supposing the strength of the wind the same), the
largest fall fastest, the smaller drops are more buoyant, and the small misty
rain floats about like a cloud, as often up as down, so that an umbrella is
useless in it; though in a heavy thunder-storm, if there is no wind, one may
stand gathered up under an umbrella without a drop touching the feet.</p>

<p>Secondly, buoyancy depends on the amount of surface which a given
weight of the substance exposes to the resistance of the substance it floats in.
Thus, gold-leaf is in a high degree buoyant, while the same quantity of gold
in a compact grain would fall like a shot; and a feather is buoyant, though
the same quantity of animal matter in a compact form would be as heavy
as a little stone. A slate blows far from a house-top, while a brick falls
vertically, or nearly so.</p>

<p><a name="ft2l" id="ft2l" href="#fa2l"><span class="fn">2</span></a> There is a beautiful passage in <i>Sartor Resartus</i> concerning this old Hebrew
scroll, in its deeper meanings, and the child&rsquo;s watching it, though long

two nearly all that is to be said about clouds.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE CLOUD-FLOCKS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. From</span> the tenor of the foregoing chapter, the reader will,
I hope, be prepared to find me, though dogmatic (it is said) upon
some occasions, anything rather than dogmatic respecting clouds.
I will assume nothing concerning them, beyond the simple fact,
that as a floating sediment forms in a saturated liquid, vapor
forms in the body of the air; and all that I want the reader to be
clear about in the outset is that this vapor floats in and with the
wind (as, if you throw any thick coloring matter into a river, it
floats with the stream), and that it is not blown before a denser
volume of the wind, as a fleece of wool would be.</p>

<p>§ 2. At whatever height they form, clouds may be broadly
considered as of two species only, massive and striated. I cannot
find a better word than massive, though it is not a good one, for
I mean it only to signify a fleecy arrangement in which no <i>lines</i>
are visible. The fleece may be so bright as to look like flying
thistle-down, or so diffused as to show no visible outline at all.
Still if it is all of one common texture, like a handful of wool, or
a wreath of smoke, I call it massive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if divided by parallel lines, so as to look
more or less like spun-glass, I call it striated. In Plate 69, Fig.
4, the top of the Aiguille Dru (Chamouni) is seen emergent above
low striated clouds, with heaped massive cloud beyond. I do not
know in the least what causes this striation, except that it depends
on the nature of the cloud, not on the wind. The strongest wind
will not throw a cloud, massive by nature, into the linear form.
It will toss it about, and tear it to pieces, but not spin it into
threads. On the other hand, often without any wind at all, the
cloud will spin itself into threads fine as gossamer. These
threads are often said to be a prognostic of storm; but they are
not produced by storm.</p>

<p>§ 3. In the first volume, we considered all clouds as belonging
to three regions, that of the cirrous, the central cloud, and the
rain-cloud. It is of course an arrangement more of convenience
than of true description, for cirrous clouds sometimes form low
as well as high; and rain sometimes falls high as well as low. I
will, nevertheless, retain this old arrangement, which is practically
as serviceable as any.</p>

<p>Allowing, also, for various exceptions and modifications, these
three bodies of cloud may be generally distinguished in our
minds thus. The clouds of upper region are for the most part
quiet, or seem to be so, owing to their distance. They are formed
now of striated, now of massive substance; but always finely divided
into large ragged flakes or ponderous heaps. These heaps
(cumuli) and flakes, or drifts, present different phenomena, but
must be joined in our minds under the head of central cloud.
The lower clouds, bearing rain abundantly, are composed partly
of striated, partly of massive substance; but may generally be
comprehended under the term rain-cloud.</p>

<p>Our business in this chapter, then, is with the upper clouds,
which, owing to their quietness and multitude, we may perhaps
conveniently think of as the &ldquo;cloud-flocks.&rdquo; And we have to
discover if any laws of beauty attach to them, such as we have
seen in mountains or tree-branches.</p>

<p>§ 4. On one of the few mornings of this winter, when the sky
was clear, and one of the far fewer, on which its clearness was
visible from the neighborhood of London,&mdash;which now entirely
loses at least two out of three sunrises, owing to the environing
smoke,&mdash;the dawn broke beneath a broad field of level purple
cloud, under which floated ranks of divided cirri, composed of
finely striated vapor.</p>

<p>It was not a sky containing any extraordinary number of these
minor clouds; but each was more than usually distinct in separation
from its neighbor, and as they showed in nearly pure pale
scarlet on the dark purple ground, they were easily to be counted.</p>

<p>§ 5. There were five or six ranks, from the zenith to the horizon;
that is to say, three distinct ones, and then two or three
more running together, and losing themselves in distance, in the
manner roughly shown in Fig. 79. The nearest rank was composed
of more than 150 rows of cloud, set obliquely, as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
figure. I counted 150 which was near the mark, and then
stopped, lest the light should fail, to count the separate clouds
in some of the rows. The average
number was 60 in each row, rather
more than less.</p>

<p>There were therefore 150×60, that
is, 9,000, separate clouds in this one
rank, or about 50,000 in the field of
sight. Flocks of Admetus under Apollo&rsquo;s
keeping. Who else could shepherd such? He by day, dog
Sirius by night; or huntress Diana herself&mdash;her bright arrows
driving away the clouds of prey that would ravage her fair flocks.
We must leave fancies, however; these wonderful clouds need
close looking at. I will try to draw one or two of them before
they fade.</p>

<p>§ 6. On doing which we find, after all, they are not much
more like sheep than Canis Major is like a dog. They resemble
more some of our old friends, the pine branches, covered with
snow. The three forming the uppermost figure, in the Plate
opposite, are as like three of the fifty thousand as I could get
them, complex enough in structure, even this single group.
Busy workers they must be, that twine the braiding of them all
to the horizon, and down beyond it.</p>

<p>And who are these workers? You have two questions here,
both difficult. What separates these thousands of clouds each
from the other, and each about equally from the other? How
can they be drawn asunder, yet not allowed to part? Looped
lace as it were, richest point&mdash;invisible threads fastening embroidered
cloud to cloud&mdash;the &ldquo;plighted clouds&rdquo; of Milton,&mdash;creatures
of the element&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">And, secondly, what bends each of them into these flame-like
curves, tender and various, as motions of a bird, hither and
thither? Perhaps you may hardly see the curves well in the
softly finished forms; here they are plainer in rude outline,

<p>Eddies of wind?</p>

<p>Nay, an eddy of wind will not stay quiet for three minutes,
as that cloud did to be drawn; as all the others did, each in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
place. You see there is perfect harmony among the curves.
They all flow into each other as the currents of a stream do. If
you throw dust that will float on the surface of a slow river, it
will arrange itself in lines somewhat like these. To a certain extent,
indeed, it is true that there are gentle currents of change in
the atmosphere, which move slowly enough to permit in the
clouds that follow them some appearance of stability. But how
to obtain change so complex in an infinite number of consecutive
spaces;&mdash;fifty thousand separate groups of current in half of a
morning sky, with quiet invisible vapor between, or none&mdash;and
yet all obedient to one ruling law, gone forth through their companies;&mdash;each
marshalled to their white standards, in great unity
of warlike march, unarrested, unconfused? &ldquo;One shall not
thrust another, they shall walk every one in his own path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 8. These questions occur, at first sight, respecting every
group of cirrus cloud. Whatever the form may be, whether
branched, as in this instance,
or merely rippled,
or thrown into shield-like
segments, as in Fig. 81&mdash;a
frequent arrangement&mdash;there
is still the same difficulty
in accounting satisfactorily
for the individual
forces which regulate
the similar shape of each mass, while all are moved by a
general force that has apparently no influence on the divided
structure. Thus the mass of clouds disposed as in Fig. 81, will
probably move, mutually, in the direction of the arrow; that is
to say, sideways, as far as their separate curvature is concerned.
I suppose it probable that as the science of electricity is more
perfectly systematized, the explanation of many circumstances
of cloud-form will be rendered by it. At present I see no use in
troubling the reader or myself with conjectures which a year&rsquo;s
progress in science might either effectively contradict or supersede.
All that I want is, that we should have our questions
ready to put clearly to the electricians when the electricians are
ready to answer us.</p>

<p>§ 9. It is possible that some of the loveliest conditions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
these parallel clouds may be owing to a structure which I forgot
to explain, when it occurred in rocks, in the course of the last
volume.</p>

<p>When they are finely stratified, and their
surfaces abraded by broad, shallow furrows, the
edges of the beds, of course, are thrown into
undulations, and at some distance, where the
furrows disappear, the surface looks as if the
rock had flowed over it in successive waves.
Such a condition is seen on the left at the top
in Fig. 17, in Vol. IV. Supposing a series of
beds of vapor cut across by a straight sloping
current of air, and so placed as to catch the
light on their edges, we should have a series
of curved lights, looking like independent
clouds.</p>

<p>§ 10. I believe conditions of form like those
in Fig. 82 (turn the book with its outer edge
down) may not unfrequently be thus, owing to
stratification, when they occur in the nearer sky.
This line of cloud is far off at the horizon, drifting
towards the left (the points of course forward),
and is, I suppose, a series of nearly circular
eddies seen in perspective.</p>

<p>Which question of perspective we must examine
a little before going a step farther. In
order to simplify it, let us assume that the under
surfaces of clouds are flat, and lie in a horizontal
extended field. This is in great measure
the fact, and notable perspective phenomena
depend on the approximation of clouds to such
a condition.</p>

<p>§ 11. Referring the reader to my Elements
of Perspective for statements of law which
would be in this place tiresome, I can only ask
him to take my word for it that the three figures in Plate 64 represent
limiting lines of sky perspective, as they would appear over
a large space of the sky. Supposing that the breadth included
was one-fourth of the horizon, the shaded portions in the central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
figure represent square fields of cloud,<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and those in the uppermost
figure narrow triangles, with their shortest side next us,
but sloping a little away from us.</p>

<p>In each figure, the shaded portions show the perspective limits
of cloud-masses, which, in reality, are arranged in perfectly
straight lines, are all similar, and are equidistant from each other.
Their exact relative positions are marked by the lines connecting
them, and may be determined by the reader if he knows perspective.
If he does not, he may be surprised at first to be told that
the stubborn and blunt little triangle, <i>b</i>, Fig. 1, Plate 64, represents
a cloud precisely similar, and similarly situated, to that
represented by the thin triangle, <i>a</i>; and, in like manner, the
stout diamond, <i>a</i>, Fig. 2, represents precisely the same form
and size of cloud as the thin strip at <i>b</i>. He may perhaps think
it still more curious that the retiring perspective which causes
stoutness in the triangle, causes leanness in the diamond.<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>§ 12. Still greater confusion in aspect is induced by the apparent
change caused by perspective in the direction of the wind.
If Fig. 3 be supposed to include a quarter of the horizon, the
spaces, into which its straight lines divide it, represent squares of
sky. The curved lines, which cross these spaces from corner to
corner, are precisely parallel throughout; and, therefore, two
clouds moving, one on the curved line from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and the other
on the other side, from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, would, in reality, be moving with
the same wind, in parallel lines. In Plate 66, which is a sketch
of an actual sunset behind Beauvais cathedral (the point of the
roof of the apse, a little to the left of the centre, shows it to be a
summer sunset), the white cirri in the high light are all moving
eastward, away from the sun, in perfectly parallel lines, curving
a little round to the south. Underneath, are two straight ranks
of rainy cirri, crossing each other; one directed south-east; the
other, north-west. The meeting perspective of these, in extreme
distance, determines the shape of the angular light which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
opens above the cathedral. Underneath all, fragments of true
rain-cloud are floating between us and the sun, governed by
curves of their own. They are, nevertheless, connected with the
straight cirri, by the dark semi-cumulus in the middle of the
shade above the cathedral.</p>

<p>§ 13. Sky perspective, however, remains perfectly simple, so
long as it can be reduced to any rectilinear arrangement; but
when nearly the whole system is curved, which nine times out of
ten is the case, it becomes embarrassing. The central figure in
Plate 65 represents the simplest possible combination of perspective
of straight lines with that of curves, a group of concentric
circles of small clouds being supposed to cast shadows from the
sun near the horizon. Such shadows are often cast in misty air;
the aspect of rays about the sun being, in fact, only caused by
spaces between them. They are carried out formally and far in
the Plate, to show how curiously they may modify the arrangement
of light in a sky. The woodcut, Fig. 83, gives roughly
the arrangement of the clouds in Turner&rsquo;s Pools of Solomon, in
which he has employed a concentric system of circles of this kind,
and thus lighted. In the perspective figure the clouds are represented
as small square masses, for the sake of greater simplicity,
and are so beaded or strung as it were on the curves in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
they move, as to keep their distances precisely equal, and their
sides parallel. This is the usual condition of cloud: for though
arranged in curved ranks, each cloud has its face to the front, or,
at all events, acts in some parallel line&mdash;generally another curve&mdash;with
those next to it: being rarely, except in the form of fine
radiating striæ, arranged on the curves as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 84; but as at
<i>b</i>, or <i>c</i>. It would make the diagram too complex if I gave one of
intersecting curves; but the lowest figure in Plate 65 represents,
in perspective, two groups of ellipses arranged in equidistant
straight and parallel lines, and following each other on two circular
curves. Their exact relative position is shown in Fig. 2,
Plate 56. While the uppermost figure in Plate 65 represents, in
parallel perspective, a series of ellipses arranged in radiation on
a circle, their exact relative size and position are shown in Fig.
3, Plate 56, and the lines of such a sky as would be produced by
them, roughly, in Fig. 90, facing page 128.<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>§ 14. And in these figures, which, if we look up the subject
rightly, would be but the first and simplest of the series necessary
to illustrate the action of the upper cirri, the reader may
see, at once, how necessarily painters, untrained in observance of
proportion, and ignorant of perspective, must lose in every touch
the expression of buoyancy and space in sky. The absolute forms
of each cloud are, indeed, not alike, as the ellipses in the engraving;
but assuredly, when moving in groups of this kind,
there are among them the same proportioned inequalities of relative
distance, the same gradated changes from ponderous to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
elongated form, the same exquisite suggestions of including
curve; and a common painter, dotting his clouds down at random,
or in more or less equal masses, can no more paint a sky,
than he could, by random dashes for its ruined arches, paint the
Coliseum.</p>

<p>§ 15. Whatever approximation to the character of upper
clouds may have been reached by some of our modern students,
it will be found, on careful analysis, that Turner stands more
absolutely alone in this gift of cloud-drawing, than in any other
of his great powers. Observe, I say, cloud-<i>drawing</i>; other great
men colored clouds beautifully; none but he ever drew them
truly: this power coming from his constant habit of drawing
skies, like everything else, with the pencil point. It is quite
impossible to engrave any of his large finished skies on a small
scale; but the woodcut, Fig. 85, will give some idea of the forms
of cloud involved in one of his small drawings. It is only half
of the sky in question, that of Rouen from St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hill,
in the Rivers of France. Its clouds are arranged on two systems
of intersecting circles, crossed beneath by long bars very slightly
bent. The form of every separate cloud is completely studied;
the manner of drawing them will be understood better by help
of the Plate opposite, which is a piece of the sky above the
&ldquo;Campo Santo,&rdquo;<a name="fa5m" id="fa5m" href="#ft5m"><span class="sp">5</span></a> at Venice, exhibited in 1842. It is exquisite
in rounding of the separate fragments and buoyancy of the rising
central group, as well as in its expression of the wayward influence
of curved lines of breeze on a generally rectilinear system of
cloud.</p>

<p>§ 16. To follow the subject farther would, however, lead us
into doctrine of circular storms, and all kinds of pleasant, but
infinite, difficulty, from which temptation I keep clear, believing
that enough is now stated to enable the reader to understand
what he is to look for in Turner&rsquo;s skies; and what kind of power,
thought, and science are involved continually in the little white
or purple dashes of cloud-spray, which, in such pictures as the
San Benedetto, looking to Fusina, the Napoleon, or the Temeraire,
guide the eye to the horizon more by their true perspective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
than by their aërial tone, and are buoyant, not so much by expression
of lightness as of motion.<a name="fa6m" id="fa6m" href="#ft6m"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>§ 17. I say the &ldquo;white or purple&rdquo; cloud-spray. One word
yet may be permitted me respecting the mystery of that color.
What should we have thought&mdash;if we had lived in a country
where there were no clouds, but only low mist or fog&mdash;of any
stranger who had told us that, in his country, these mists rose
into the air, and became purple, crimson, scarlet, and gold? I
am aware of no sufficient explanation of these hues of the upper
clouds, nor of their strange mingling of opacity with a power of
absorbing light. All clouds are so opaque that, however delicate
they may be, you never see one through another. Six feet depth
of them, at a little distance, will wholly veil the darkest mountain
edge; so that, whether for light or shade, they tell upon the sky
as body color on canvas; they have always a perfect surface and
bloom;&mdash;delicate as a rose-leaf, when required of them, but never
poor or meagre in hue, like old-fashioned water-colors. And, if
needed, in mass, they will bear themselves for solid force of hue
against any rock. Facing p. 339, I have engraved a memorandum
made of a clear sunset after rain, from the top of Milan
cathedral. The greater part of the outline is granite&mdash;Monte
Rosa&mdash;the rest cloud; but it and the granite were dark alike.
Frequently, in effects of this kind, the cloud is darker of the two.<a name="fa7m" id="fa7m" href="#ft7m"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
And this opacity is, nevertheless, obtained without destroying the
gift they have of letting broken light through them, so that, between
us and the sun, they may become golden fleeces, and float
as fields of light.</p>

<p>Now their distant colors depend on these two properties together;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
partly on the opacity, which enables them to reflect light
strongly; partly on a spongelike power of gathering light into
their bodies.</p>

<p>§ 18. Long ago it was noted by Aristotle, and again by Leonardo,
that vaporous bodies looked russet, or even red, when warm
light was seen through them, and blue when deep shade was
seen through them. Both colors may, generally, be seen on any
wreath of cottage smoke.</p>

<p>Whereon, easy conclusion has sometimes been founded by
modern reasoners. All red in sky is caused by light seen through
vapor, and all blue by shade seen through vapor.</p>

<p>Easy, indeed, but not sure, even in cloud-color only. It is
true that the smoke of a town may be of a rich brick red against
golden twilight; and of a very lovely, though not bright, blue
against shade. But I never saw crimson or scarlet smoke, nor
ultramarine smoke.</p>

<p>Even granting that watery vapor in its purity may give the
colors more clearly, the red colors are by no means always relieved
against light. The finest scarlets are constantly seen in broken
flakes on a deep purple ground of heavier cloud beyond, and some
of the loveliest rose-colors on clouds in the east, opposite the sunset,
or in the west in the morning. Nor are blues always attainable
by throwing vapor over shade. Especially, you cannot get
them by putting it over blue itself. A thin vapor on dark blue
sky is of a warm gray, not blue. A thunder-cloud, deep enough
to conceal everything behind it, is often dark lead-color, or sulphurous
blue; but the thin vapors crossing it, milky-white. The
vividest hues are connected also with another attribute of clouds,
their lustre&mdash;metallic in effect, watery in reality. They not only
reflect color as dust or wool would, but, when far off, as water
would; sometimes even giving a distinct image of the sun underneath
the orb itself;&mdash;in all cases becoming dazzling in lustre,
when at a low angle, capable of strong reflection. Practically,
this low angle is only obtained when the cloud seems near the
sun, and hence we get into the careless habit of looking at the
golden reflected light as if it were actually caused by nearness to
the fiery ball.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">66. Light in the West, Beauvais.</td></tr></table>

<p>§ 19. Without, however, troubling ourselves at all about laws,
or causes of color, the visible consequences of their operation are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
notably these&mdash;that when near us, clouds present only subdued
and uncertain colors; but when far from us, and struck by the
sun on their under surfaces&mdash;so that the greater part of the light
they receive is reflected&mdash;they may become golden, purple, scarlet,
and intense fiery white, mingled in all kinds of gradations,
such as I tried to describe in the chapter on the upper clouds in
the first volume, in hope of being able to return to them &ldquo;when
we knew what was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question before us now is, therefore, What value ought
this attribute of clouds to possess in the human mind? Ought
we to admire their colors, or despise them? Is it well to watch
them as Turner does, and strive to paint them through all deficiency
and darkness of inadequate material? Or, is it wiser and
nobler&mdash;like Claude, Salvator, Ruysdael, Wouvermans&mdash;never to
look for them&mdash;never to portray? We must yet have patience a
little before deciding this, because we have to ascertain some facts
respecting the typical meaning of color itself; which, reserving
for another place, let us proceed here to learn the forms of the
inferior clouds.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1m" id="ft1m" href="#fa1m"><span class="fn">1</span></a> Before going farther, I must say a word or two respecting method of
drawing clouds.</p>

<p>Absolutely well no cloud <i>can</i> be drawn with the point; nothing but the
most delicate management of the brush will express its variety of edge and
texture. By laborious and tender engraving, a close approximation may be
obtained either to nature or to good painting; and the engravings of sky by
our modern line engravers are often admirable;&mdash;in many respects as good as
can be, and to my mind the best part of their work. There still exist some
early proofs of Miller&rsquo;s plate of the Grand Canal, Venice, in which the sky
is the likest thing to Turner&rsquo;s work I have ever seen in large engravings.
The plate was spoiled after a few impressions were taken off by desire of
the publisher. The sky was so exactly like Turner&rsquo;s that he thought it
would not please the public, and had all the fine cloud-drawing rubbed away
to make it soft.</p>

<p>The Plate opposite page 118, by Mr. Armytage, is also, I think, a superb
specimen of engraving, though in result not so good as the one just spoken
of, because this was done from my copy of Turner&rsquo;s sky, not from the picture
itself.</p>

<p>But engraving of this finished kind cannot, by reason of its costliness, be
given for every illustration of cloud form. Nor, if it could, can skies be
sketched with the completion which would bear it. It is sometimes possible
to draw one cloud out of fifty thousand with something like fidelity before
it fades. But if we want the arrangement of the fifty thousand, they can
only be indicated with the rudest lines, and finished from memory. It was,
as we shall see presently, only by his gigantic powers of memory that Turner
was enabled to draw skies as he did.</p>

<p>Now, I look upon my own memory of clouds, or of anything else, as of
no value whatever. All the drawings on which I have ever rested an assertion
have been made without stirring from the spot; and in sketching clouds
from nature, it is very seldom desirable to use the brush. For broad effects
and notes of color (though these, hastily made, are always inaccurate, and
letters indicating the color do nearly as well) the brush may be sometimes
useful, but, in most cases, a dark pencil, which will lay shade with its side
and draw lines with its point, is the best instrument. Turner almost always
outlined merely with the point, being able to remember the relations of shade
without the slightest chance of error. The point, at all events, is needful,
however much stump work may be added to it.</p>

<p>Now, in translating sketches made with the pencil point into engraving,
we must either engrave delicately and expensively, or be content to substitute
for the soft varied pencil lines the finer and uncloudlike touches of the
pen. It is best to do this boldly, if at all, and without the least aim at fineness
of effect, to lay down a vigorous black line as the limit of the cloud
form or action. The more subtle a painter&rsquo;s finished work, the more fearless
he is in using the vigorous black line when he is making memoranda, of
treating his subject conventionally. At the top of page 224, Vol. IV., the
reader may see the kind of outline which Titian uses for clouds in his pen
work. Usually he is even bolder and coarser. And in the rude woodcuts I
am going to employ here, I believe the reader will find ultimately that, with
whatever ill success used by me, the means of expression are the fullest and
most convenient that can be adopted, short of finished engraving, while there
are some conditions of cloud-action which I satisfy myself better in expressing
by these coarse lines than in any other way.</p>

<p><a name="ft2m" id="ft2m" href="#fa2m"><span class="fn">2</span></a> If the figures are supposed to include less than one-fourth of the horizon,
the shaded figures represent diamond-shaped clouds; but the reader
cannot understand this without studying perspective laws accurately.</p>

<p><a name="ft3m" id="ft3m" href="#fa3m"><span class="fn">3</span></a> In reality, the retiring ranks of cloud, if long enough, would, of course,
go on converging to the horizon. I do not continue them, because the
figures would become too compressed.</p>

<p><a name="ft4m" id="ft4m" href="#fa4m"><span class="fn">4</span></a> I use ellipses in order to make these figures easily intelligible; the
curves actually <i>are</i> variable curves, of the nature of the cycloid, or other
curves of continuous motion; probably produced by a current moving in
some such direction as that indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 3, Plate 56.</p>

<p><a name="ft5m" id="ft5m" href="#fa5m"><span class="fn">5</span></a> Now in the possession of E. Bicknell, Esq., who kindly lent me the picture,
that I might make this drawing from it carefully.</p>

<p><a name="ft6m" id="ft6m" href="#fa6m"><span class="fn">6</span></a> I cannot yet engrave these; but the little study of a single rank of cirrus,
the lowest in Plate 63, may serve to show the value of perspective in expressing
buoyancy. It is not, however, though beautifully engraved by Mr.
Armytage, as delicate as it should be, in the finer threads which indicate increasing
distance at the extremity. Compare the rising of the lines of curve
at the edges of this mass, with the similar action on a larger scale, of Turner&rsquo;s
cloud, opposite.</p>

<p><a name="ft7m" id="ft7m" href="#fa7m"><span class="fn">7</span></a> In the autobiography of John Newton there is an interesting account of
the deception of a whole ship&rsquo;s company by cloud, taking the aspect and
outline of mountainous land. They ate the last provision in the ship, so
sure were they of its being land, and were nearly starved to death in consequence.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE CLOUD-CHARIOTS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Between</span> the flocks of small countless clouds which
occupy the highest heavens, and the gray undivided film of the
true rain-cloud, form the fixed masses or torn fleeces, sometimes
collected and calm, sometimes fiercely drifting, which are, nevertheless,
known under one general name of cumulus, or heaped
cloud.</p>

<p>The true cumulus, the most majestic of all clouds, and almost
the only one which attracts the notice of ordinary observers, is
for the most part windless; the movement of its masses being
solemn, continuous, inexplicable, a steady advance or retiring, as
if they were animated by an inner will, or compelled by an unseen
power. They appear to be peculiarly connected with heat, forming
perfectly only in the afternoon, and melting away in the evening.
Their noblest conditions are strongly electric, and connect
themselves with storm-cloud and true thunder-cloud. When
there is thunder in the air, they will form in cold weather, or
early in the day.</p>

<p>§ 2. I have never succeeded in drawing a cumulus. Its divisions
of surface are grotesque and endless, as those of a mountain;&mdash;perfectly
defined, brilliant beyond all power of color, and
transitory as a dream. Even Turner never attempted to paint
them, any more than he did the snows of the high Alps.</p>

<p>Nor can I explain them any more than I can draw them.
The ordinary account given of their structure is, I believe, that
the moisture raised from the earth by the sun&rsquo;s heat becomes
visible by condensation at a certain height in the colder air, that
the level of the condensing point is that of the cloud&rsquo;s base, and
that above it, the heaps are pushed up higher and higher as more
vapor accumulates, till, towards evening, the supply beneath
ceases; and at sunset, the fall of dew enables the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
atmosphere to absorb and melt them away. Very plausible. But
it seems to me herein unexplained how the vapor is held together
in those heaps. If the clear air about and above it has no aqueous
vapor in it, or at least a much less quantity, why does not the
clear air keep pulling the cloud to pieces, eating it away, as
steam is consumed in open air? Or, if any cause prevents such
rapid devouring of it, why does not the aqueous vapor diffuse
itself softly in the air like smoke, so that one would not know
where the cloud ended? What should make it bind itself in
those solid mounds, and stay so:&mdash;positive, fantastic, defiant,
determined?</p>

<p>§ 3. If ever I am able to understand the process of the cumulus
formation,<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> it will become to me one of the most interesting
of all subjects of study to trace the connection of the threatening
and terrible outlines of thunder-cloud with the increased
action of the electric power. I am for the present utterly unable
to speak respecting this matter, and must pass it by, in all humility,
to say what little I have ascertained respecting the more
broken and rapidly moving forms of the central clouds, which
connect themselves with mountains, and may, therefore, among
mountains, be seen close and truly.</p>

<p>§ 4. Yet even of these, I can only reason with great doubt and
continual pause. This last volume ought certainly to be better
than the first of the series, for two reasons. I have learned, during
the sixteen years, to say little where I said much, and to see
difficulties where I saw none. And I am in a great state of
marvel in looking back to my first account of clouds, not only at
myself, but even at my dear master, M. de Saussure. To think
that both of us should have looked at drifting mountain clouds,
for years together, and been content with the theory which you
will find set forth in § 4, of the chapter on the central cloud
region (Vol. I.), respecting the action of the snowy summits and
watery vapor passing them. It is quite true that this action takes
place, and that the said fourth paragraph is right, as far as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
reaches. But both Saussure and I ought to have known&mdash;we
both did know, but did not think of it&mdash;that the covering or cap-cloud
forms on hot summits as well as cold ones;&mdash;that the red
and bare rocks of Mont Pilate, hotter, certainly, after a day&rsquo;s
sunshine than the cold storm-wind which sweeps to them from
the Alps, nevertheless have been renowned for their helmet of
cloud, ever since the Romans watched the cloven summit, gray
against the south, from the ramparts of Vindonissa, giving it the
name from which the good Catholics of Lucerne have warped out
their favorite piece of terrific sacred biography.<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> And both my
master and I should also have reflected, that if our theory about
its formation had been generally true, the helmet cloud ought to
form on every cold summit, at the approach of rain, in approximating
proportions to the bulk of the glaciers; which is so far
from being the case that not only (A) the cap-cloud may often
be seen on lower summits of grass or rock, while the higher ones
are splendidly clear (which may be accounted for by supposing
the wind containing the moisture not to have risen so high), but
(B) the cap-cloud always shows a preference for hills of a conical
form, such as the Mole or Niesen, which can have very little
power in chilling the air, even supposing they were cold themselves,
while it will entirely refuse to form round huge masses of
mountain, which, supposing them of chilly temperament, must
have discomforted the atmosphere in their neighborhood for
leagues. And finally (C) reversing the principle under letter A,
the cap-cloud constantly forms on the summit of Mont Blanc,
while it will obstinately refuse to appear on the Dome du Goûte
or Aiguille Sans-nom, where the snow-fields are of greater extent,
and the air must be moister, because lower.</p>

<p>§ 5. The fact is, that the explanation given in that fourth
paragraph can, in reality, account only for what may properly be
termed &ldquo;lee-side cloud,&rdquo; slightly noticed in the continuation of
the same chapter, but deserving most attentive illustration, as
one of the most beautiful phenomena of the Alps. When a
moist wind blows in clear weather over a cold summit, it has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
time to get chilled as it approaches the rock, and therefore the
air remains clear, and the sky bright on the windward side; but
under the lee of the peak, there is partly a back eddy, and partly
still air; and in that lull and eddy the wind gets time to be
chilled by the rock, and the cloud appears as a boiling mass of
white vapor, rising continually with the return current to the
upper edge of the mountain,
where it is caught
by the straight wind, and
partly torn, partly melted
away in broken fragments.
In Fig. 86 the
dark mass represents the
mountain peak, the arrow
the main direction of the
wind, the curved lines
show the directions of such current and its concentration, and
the dotted lines enclose the space in which cloud forms densely,
floating away beyond and above in irregular tongues and flakes.
The second figure from the top in Plate 69 represents the actual
aspect of it when in full development, with a strong south wind,
in a clear day, on the Aiguille Dru, the sky being perfectly blue
and lovely around.</p>

<p>So far all is satisfactory. But the true helmet cloud will not
allow itself to be thus explained away. The uppermost figure in
Plate 69 represents the loveliest form of it, seen in that perfect
arch, so far as I know, only over the highest piece of earth in
Europe.</p>

<p>§ 6. Respecting which there are two mysteries:&mdash;First, why
it should form only at a certain distance above the snow, showing
blue sky between it and the summit. Secondly, why, so forming,
it should always show as an arch, not as a concave cup. This
last question puzzles me especially. For, if it be a true arch,
and not a cup, it ought to show itself in certain positions of the
spectator, or directions of the wind, like the ring of Saturn, as a
mere line, or as a spot of cloud pausing over the hill-top. But I
never saw it so. While, as above noticed, the lowest form of the
helmet cloud is not white as of silver, but like Dolon&rsquo;s helmet of
wolf-skin,&mdash;it is a gray, flaky veil, lapping itself over the shoulders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
of a more or less conical peak; and of this, also, I have no word
to utter but the old one, &ldquo;Electricity,&rdquo; and I might as well say
nothing.</p>

<p>§ 7. Neither the helmet cloud, nor the lee-side cloud, however,
though most interesting and beautiful, are of much importance
in picturesque effect. They are too isolated and strange. But
the great mountain cloud, which seems to be a blending of the
two with independent forms of vapor (that is to say, a greater
development, in consequence of the mountain&rsquo;s action, of clouds
which would in some way or other have formed anywhere), requires
prolonged attention, as the principal element of the sky
in noblest landscape.</p>

<p>§ 8. For which purpose, first, it may be well to clear a few
clouds out of the way. I believe the true cumulus is never seen
in a great mountain region, at least never associated with hills.
It is always broken up and modified by them. Boiling and
rounded masses of vapor occur continually, as behind the Aiguille
Dru (lowest figure in Plate 69); but the quiet, thoroughly defined,
infinitely divided and modelled pyramid never develops
itself. It would be very grand if one ever saw a great mountain
peak breaking through the domed shoulders of a true cumulus;
but this I have never seen.</p>

<p>§ 9. Again, the true high cirri never cross a mountain in
Europe. How often have I hoped to see an Alp rising through
and above their level-laid and rippled fields! but those white harvest-fields
are heaven&rsquo;s own. And, finally, even the low, level,
cirrus (used so largely in Martin&rsquo;s pictures) rarely crosses a
mountain. If it does, it usually becomes slightly waved or
broken, so as to destroy its character. Sometimes, however, at
great distances, a very level bar of cloud will strike across a peak;
but nearer, too much of the under surface of the field is seen, so
that a well-defined bar across a peak, seen at a high angle, is of
the greatest rarity.</p>

<p>§ 10. The ordinary mountain cloud, therefore, if well defined,
divides itself into two kinds: a broken condition of cumulus,
grand in proportion as it is solid and quiet,&mdash;and a strange modification
of drift-cloud, midway, as I said, between the helmet
and the lee-side forms. The broken, quiet cumulus impressed
Turner exceedingly when he first saw it on hills. He uses it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
slightly exaggerating its definiteness, in all his early studies
among the mountains of the Chartreuse, and very beautifully in
the vignette of St. Maurice in Rogers&rsquo;s Italy. There is nothing,
however, to be specially observed of it, as it only differs from the
cumulus of the plains, by being smaller and more broken.</p>

<p>§ 11. Not so the mountain drift-cloud, which is as peculiar
as it is majestic. The Plates 70 and 71 show, as well as I can
express, two successive phases of it on a mountain crest; (in this
instance the great limestone ridge above St. Michel, in Savoy.)
But what colossal proportions this noble cloud assumes may be
best gathered from the rude sketch, Fig. 87, in which I have
simply put firm black ink over the actual pencil lines made at the
moment, giving the form of a single wreath of the drift-cloud,
stretching about five miles in a direct line from the summit of
one of the Alps of the Val d&rsquo;Aosta, as seen from the plain of
Turin. It has a grand volcanic look, but I believe its aspect of
rising from the peak to be almost, if not altogether, deceptive;
and that the apparently gigantic column is a nearly horizontal
stream of lee-side cloud, tapered into the distance by perspective,
and thus rising at its apparently lowest but in reality most distant
point, from the mountain summit whose shade calls it into
being out of the clear winds.</p>

<p>Whether this be so or not, the apparent origin of the cloud
on the peak, and radiation from it, distinguish it from the
drift-cloud of level country, which arranges itself at the horizon
in broken masses, such as Fig. 89, showing no point of origin;
and I do not know how far they are vertical cliffs or horizontally
extended fields. They are apt to be very precipitous in aspect,
breaking into fragments with an apparently concentric motion,
as in the figure; but of this motion also&mdash;whether vertical or
horizontal&mdash;I can say nothing positive.</p>

<p>§ 12. The absolute scale of such clouds may be seen, or at
least demonstrated, more clearly in Fig. 88, which is a rough
note of an effect of sky behind the tower of Berne Cathedral. It
was made from the mound beside the railroad bridge. The
Cathedral tower is half-a-mile distant. The great Eiger of Grindelwald
is seen just on the right of it. This mountain is distant
from the tower thirty-four miles as the crow flies, and ten thousand
feet above it in height. The drift-cloud behind it, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
being in full light, and showing no overhanging surfaces,
must rise at least twenty thousand feet into the air.</p>

<p>§ 13. The extreme whiteness of the volume of vapor in this
case (not, I fear, very intelligible in the woodcut<a name="fa3n" id="fa3n" href="#ft3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a>) may be partly
owing to recent rain, which, by its evaporation, gives a peculiar
density and brightness to some forms of clearing cloud. In order
to understand this, we must consider another set of facts. When
weather is thoroughly wet among hills, we ought no more to accuse
the mountains of forming the clouds, than we do the plains
in similar circumstances. The unbroken mist buries the mountains
to their bases; but that is not their fault. It may be just
as wet and just as cloudy elsewhere. (This is not true of Scottish
mountain, by the way.) But when the wet weather is breaking,
and the clouds pass, perhaps, in great measure, away from
the plains leaving large spaces of blue sky, the mountains begin
to shape clouds for themselves. The fallen moisture evaporates
from the plain invisibly; but not so from the hill-side. There,
what quantity of rain has not gone down in the torrents, ascends
again to heaven instantly in white clouds. The storm passes as
if it had tormented the crags, and the strong mountains smoke
like tired horses.</p>

<p>§ 14. Here is another question for us of some interest. Why
does the much greater quantity of moisture lying on the horizontal
fields send up no visible vapor, and the less quantity left
on the rocks glorify itself into a magnificent wreath of soaring
snow?</p>

<p>First, for the very reason, that it is less in quantity, and more
distributed; as a wet cloth smokes when you put it near the fire,
but a basin of water not.</p>

<p>The previous heat of the crags, noticed in the first volume, p.
249, is only a part of the cause. It operates only locally, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
remains of sudden showers. But after any number of days and
nights of rain, and in all places exposed to returning sunshine
and breezes, the <i>distribution</i> of the moisture tells. So soon as
the rain has ceased, all water that can run off is of course gone
from the steep hill-sides; there remains only the thin adherent
film of moisture to be dried; but that film is spread over a complex
texture&mdash;all manner of crannies, and bosses, and projections,
and filaments of moss and lichen, exposing a vast extent of drying
surface to the air. And the evaporation is rapid in proportion.</p>

<p>§ 15. Its rapidity, however, observe, does not account for its
visibility, and this is one of the questions I cannot clearly solve,
unless I were sure of the nature of the vesicular vapor. When
our breath becomes visible on a frosty day, it is easily enough
understood that the moisture which was invisible, carried by the
warm air from the lungs, becomes visible when condensed or precipitated
by the surrounding chill; but one does not see why air
passing over a moist surface quite as cold as itself should take up
one particle of water more than it can conveniently&mdash;that is to
say, invisibly&mdash;carry. Whenever you <i>see</i> vapor, you may not inaccurately
consider the air as having got more than it can properly
hold, and dropping some. Now it is easily understood how
it should take up much in the lungs, and let some of it fall when
it is pinched by the frost outside; but why should it overload
itself there on the hills, when it is at perfect liberty to fly away as
soon as it likes, and come back for more? I do not see my way
well in this. I do not see it clearly, even through the wet cloth.
I shall leave all the embarrassment of the matter, however, to my
reader, contenting myself, as usual, with the actual fact, that the
hill-side air does behave in this covetous and unreasonable manner;
and that, in consequence, when the weather is breaking
(and sometimes, provokingly, when it is not), phantom clouds
form and rise in sudden crowds of wild and spectral imagery
along all the far succession of the hill-slopes and ravines.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<p>§ 16. There is this distinction, however, between the clouds
that form during the rain and after it. In the worst weather,
the rain-cloud keeps rather high, and is unbroken; but when
there is a disposition in the rain to relax, every now and then a
sudden company of white clouds will form quite low down (in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
Chamouni or Grindelwald, and such high districts, even down
to the bottom of the valley), which will remain, perhaps, for ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
minutes, filling all the air, then disappear as suddenly as they
came, leaving the gray upper cloud and steady rain to their work.
These &ldquo;clouds of relaxation,&rdquo; if we may so call them, are usually
flaky and horizontal, sometimes tending to the silky cirrus, yet
showing no fine forms of drift; but when the rain has passed, and
the air is getting warm, forms the true clearing cloud, in wreaths
that ascend continually with a slow circling motion, melting as
they rise. The woodcut, Fig. 91, is a rude note of it floating
more quietly from the hill of the Superga, the church (nearly as
large as St. Paul&rsquo;s) appearing above, and thus showing the scale
of the wreath.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 92.</td></tr></table>

<p>§ 17. This cloud of evaporation, however, does not always
rise. It sometimes rests in absolute stillness, low laid in the hollows
of the hills, their peaks emergent from it. Fig. 92 shows
this condition of it, seen from a distance, among the Cenis hills.
I do not know what gives it this disposition to rest in the ravines,
nor whether there is a greater chill in the hollows, or a real action
of gravity on the particles of cloud. In general, the position
seems to depend on the temperature. Thus, in Chamouni, the
crests of La Côte and Taconay continually appear in stormy weather
as in Plate 36, Vol. IV., in which I intended to represent rising
drift-cloud, made dense between the crests by the chill from the
glaciers. But in the condition shown in Fig. 92, on a comparatively
open sweep of hill-side, the thermometer would certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
indicate a higher temperature in the sheltered valley than on the
exposed peaks; yet the cloud still subsides into the valleys like
folds of a garment; and, more than this, sometimes conditions
of morning cloud, dependent, I believe, chiefly on dew evaporation,
form first on the <i>tops</i> of the soft hills of wooded Switzerland,
and droop down in rent fringes, and separate tongues, clinging
close to all the hill-sides, and giving them exactly the appearance
of being covered with white fringed cloth, falling over them
in torn or divided folds. It always looks like a true action of
gravity. How far it is, in reality, the indication of the power
of the rising sun causing evaporation, first on the hill-top,
and then in separate streams, by its divided light on the ravines,
I cannot tell. The subject is, as the reader perceives, always
inextricably complicated by these three necessities&mdash;that to get
a cloud in any given spot, you must have moisture to form the
material of it, heat to develop it, and cold<a name="fa4n" id="fa4n" href="#ft4n"><span class="sp">4</span></a> to show it; and
the adverse causes inducing the moisture, the evaporation, and
the visibility are continually interchanged in presence and in
power. And thus, also, the phenomena which properly belong
to a certain elevation are confused, among hills at least, with
those which in plains would have been lower or higher.</p>

<p>I have been led unavoidably in this chapter to speak of some
conditions of the rain-cloud; nor can we finally understand the
forms even of the cumulus, without considering those into which
it descends or diffuses itself. Which, however, being, I think, a
little more interesting than our work hitherto, we will leave this
chapter to its dulness, and begin another.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1n" id="ft1n" href="#fa1n"><span class="fn">1</span></a> One of the great difficulties in doing this is to distinguish the portions of
cloud outline which really slope upwards from those which only appear to
do so, being in reality horizontal, and thrown into apparent inclination by
perspective.</p>

<p><a name="ft2n" id="ft2n" href="#fa2n"><span class="fn">2</span></a> <i>Pileatus</i>, capped (strictly speaking, with the cap of liberty;&mdash;stormy

<p><a name="ft3n" id="ft3n" href="#fa3n"><span class="fn">3</span></a> I could not properly illustrate the subject of clouds without numbers
of these rude drawings, which would probably offend the general reader by
their coarseness, while the cost of engraving them in facsimile is considerable,
and would much add to the price of the book. If I find people at all
interested in the subject, I may, perhaps, some day systematize and publish
my studies of cloud separately. I am sorry not to have given in this volume
a careful study of a rich cirrus sky, but no wood-engraving that I can employ
on this scale will express the finer threads and waves.</p>

<p><a name="ft4n" id="ft4n" href="#fa4n"><span class="fn">4</span></a>  We might say light, as well as cold; for it wholly depends on the degree
of light in the sky how far delicate cloud is seen.</p>

<p>The second figure from the top in Plate 69 shows an effect of morning
light on the range of the Aiguille Bouchard (Chamouni). Every crag casts
its shadow up into apparently clear sky. The shadow is, in such cases, a
bluish gray, the color of clear sky; and the defining light is caused by the
sunbeams showing mist which otherwise would have been unperceived.
The shadows are not irregular enough in outline&mdash;the sketch was made for
their color and sharpness, not their shape,&mdash;and I cannot now put them
right, so I leave them as they were drawn at the moment.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE ANGEL OF THE SEA.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Perhaps</span> the best and truest piece of work done in the
first volume of this book, was the account given in it of the rain-cloud;
to which I have here little, descriptively, to add. But
the question before us now is, not who has drawn the rain-cloud
best, but if it were worth drawing at all. Our English artists
naturally painted it often and rightly; but are their pictures the
better for it? We have seen how mountains are beautiful; how
trees are beautiful; how sun-lighted clouds are beautiful; but
can rain be beautiful?</p>

<p>I spoke roughly of the Italian painters in that chapter, because
they could only draw distinct clouds, or violent storms,
&ldquo;massive concretions,&rdquo; while our northern painters could represent
every phase of mist and fall of shower.</p>

<p>But is this indeed so delightful? Is English wet weather,
indeed, one of the things which we should desire to see Art give
perpetuity to?</p>

<p>Yes, assuredly. I have given some reasons for this answer in
the fifth chapter of last volume; one or two, yet unnoticed,
belong to the present division of our subject.</p>

<p>§ 2. The climates or lands into which our globe is divided
may, with respect to their fitness for Art, be perhaps conveniently
ranged under five heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Forest-lands, sustaining the great mass of the magnificent
vegetation of the tropics, for the most part characterized by
moist and unhealthy heat, and watered by enormous rivers, or
periodical rains. This country cannot, I believe, develop the
mind or art of man. He may reach great subtlety of intellect,
as the Indian, but not become learned, nor produce any noble
art, only a savage or grotesque form of it. Even supposing the
evil influences of climate could be vanquished, the scenery is on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
too large a scale. It would be difficult to conceive of groves less
fit for academic purposes than those mentioned by Humboldt,
into which no one can enter except under a stout wooden shield,
to avoid the chance of being killed by the fall of a nut.</p>

<p>2. Sand-lands, including the desert and dry-rock plains of
the earth, inhabited generally by a nomade population, capable
of high mental cultivation and of solemn monumental or religious
art, but not of art in which pleasurableness forms a large
element, their life being essentially one of hardship.</p>

<p>3. Grape and wheat lands, namely, rocks and hills, such as
are good for the vine, associated with arable ground forming the
noblest and best ground given to man. In these districts only
art of the highest kind seems possible, the religious art of the
sand-lands being here joined with that of pleasure or sense.</p>

<p>4. Meadow-lands, including the great pastoral and agricultural
districts of the North, capable only of an inferior art: apt
to lose its spirituality and become wholly material.</p>

<p>5. Moss-lands, including the rude forest-mountain and
ground of the North, inhabited by a healthy race, capable of
high mental cultivation and moral energy, but wholly incapable
of art, except savage, like that of the forest-lands, or as in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>We might carry out these divisions into others, but these are
I think essential, and easily remembered in a tabular form; saying
&ldquo;wood&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;forest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;field&rdquo; for &ldquo;meadow,&rdquo; we
can get such a form shortly worded:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Wood-lands</td> <td class="tcl">Shrewd intellect</td> <td class="tcl">No art.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Sand-lands</td> <td class="tcl">High intellect</td> <td class="tcl">Religious art.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl">Moss-lands</td> <td class="tcl">Shrewd intellect</td> <td class="tcl">No art.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>§ 3. In this table the moss-lands appear symmetrically opposed
to the wood-lands, which in a sort they are; the too
diminutive vegetation under bleakest heaven, opposed to the too
colossal under sultriest heaven, while the perfect ministry of the
elements, represented by bread and wine, produces the perfect
soul of man.</p>

<p>But this is not altogether so. The moss-lands have one great
advantage over the forest-lands, namely, sight of the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span></p>

<p>And not only sight of it, but continual and beneficent help
from it. What they have to separate them from barren rock,
namely, their moss and streams, being dependent on its direct
help, not on great rivers coming from distant mountain chains,
nor on vast tracts of ocean-mist coming up at evening, but on
the continual play and change of sun and cloud.</p>

<p>§ 4. Note this word &ldquo;change.&rdquo; The moss-lands have an
infinite advantage, not only in sight, but in liberty; they are the
freest ground in all the world. You can only traverse the great
woods by crawling like a lizard, or climbing like a monkey&mdash;the
great sands with slow steps and veiled head. But bare-headed,
and open-eyed, and free-limbed, commanding all the horizon&rsquo;s
space of changeful light, and all the horizon&rsquo;s compass of tossing
ground, you traverse the moss-land. In discipline it is severe as
the desert, but it is a discipline compelling to action; and the
moss-lands seem, therefore, the rough schools of the world, in
which its strongest human frames are knit and tried, and so
bent down, like the northern winds, to brace and brighten the
languor into which the repose of more favored districts may
degenerate.</p>

<p>§ 5. It would be strange, indeed, if there were no beauty in
the phenomena by which this great renovating and purifying
work is done. And it is done almost entirely by the great Angel
of the Sea&mdash;rain;&mdash;the Angel, observe, the messenger sent to a
special place on a special errand. Not the diffused perpetual
presence of the burden of mist, but the going and returning of
intermittent cloud. All turns upon that intermittence. Soft
moss on stone and rock;&mdash;cave-fern of tangled glen; wayside
well&mdash;perennial, patient, silent, clear; stealing through its
square font of rough-hewn stone; ever thus deep&mdash;no more&mdash;which
the winter wreck sullies not, the summer thirst wastes
not, incapable of stain as of decline&mdash;where the fallen leaf floats
undecayed, and the insect darts undefiling. Cressed brook and
ever-eddying river, lifted even in flood scarcely over its stepping-stones,&mdash;but
through all sweet summer keeping tremulous music
with harp-strings of dark water among the silver fingering of
the pebbles. Far away in the south the strong river Gods have
all hasted, and gone down to the sea. Wasted and burning,
white furnaces of blasting sand, their broad beds lie ghastly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
bare; but here the soft wings of the Sea Angel droop still with
dew, and the shadows of their plumes falter on the hills: strange
laughings, and glitterings of silver streamlets, born suddenly,
and twined about the mossy heights in trickling tinsel, answering
to them as they wave.<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>§ 6. Nor are those wings colorless. We habitually think of
the rain-cloud only as dark and gray; not knowing that we owe
to it perhaps the fairest, though not the most dazzling of the
hues of heaven. Often in our English mornings, the rain-clouds
in the dawn form soft level fields, which melt imperceptibly into
the blue; or when of less extent, gather into apparent bars,
crossing the sheets of broader cloud above; and all these bathed
throughout in an unspeakable light of pure rose-color, and purple,
and amber, and blue; not shining, but misty-soft; the
barred masses, when seen nearer, composed of clusters or tresses
of cloud, like floss silk; looking as if each knot were a little
swathe or sheaf of lighted rain. No clouds form such skies, none
are so tender, various, inimitable. Turner himself never caught
them. Correggio, putting out his whole strength, could have
painted them, no other man.<a name="fa2o" id="fa2o" href="#ft2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span></p>

<p>§ 7. For these are the robes of love of the Angel of the Sea.
To these that name is chiefly given, the &ldquo;spreadings of the
clouds,&rdquo; from their extent, their gentleness, their fulness of rain.
Note how they are spoken of in Job xxxvi. v. 29-31. &ldquo;By
them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
With clouds he covereth the light.<a name="fa3o" id="fa3o" href="#ft3o"><span class="sp">3</span></a> He hath hidden the light
in his hands, and commanded that it should return. He speaks
of it to his friend; that it is his possession, and that he may
ascend thereto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That, then, is the Sea Angel&rsquo;s message to God&rsquo;s friends; <i>that</i>,
the meaning of those strange golden lights and purple flushes
before the morning rain. The rain is sent to judge, and feed
us; but the light is the possession of the friends of God, and
they may ascend thereto,&mdash;where the tabernacle veil will cross
and part its rays no more.</p>

<p>§ 8. But the Angel of the Sea has also another message,&mdash;in
the &ldquo;great rain of his strength,&rdquo; rain of trial, sweeping away ill-set
foundations. Then his robe is not spread softly over the
whole heaven, as a veil, but sweeps back from his shoulders,
ponderous, oblique, terrible&mdash;leaving his sword-arm free.</p>

<p>The approach of trial-storm, hurricane-storm, is indeed in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
vastness as the clouds of the softer rain. But it is not slow nor
horizontal, but swift and steep: swift with passion of ravenous
winds; steep as slope of some dark, hollowed hill. The fronting
clouds come leaning forward, one thrusting the other aside, or
on; impatient, ponderous, impendent, like globes of rock tossed
of Titans&mdash;Ossa on Olympus&mdash;but hurled forward all, in one
wave of cloud-lava&mdash;cloud whose throat is as a sepulchre. Fierce
behind them rages the oblique wrath of the rain, white as ashes,
dense as showers of driven steel; the pillars of it full of ghastly
life; Rain-Furies, shrieking as they fly;&mdash;scourging, as with
whips of scorpions;&mdash;the earth ringing and trembling under
them, heaven wailing wildly, the trees stooped blindly down,
covering their faces, quivering in every leaf with horror, ruin of
their branches flying by them like black stubble.</p>

<p>§ 9. I wrote Furies. I ought to have written Gorgons. Perhaps
the reader does not know that the Gorgons are not dead,
are ever undying. We shall have to take our chance of being
turned into stones by looking them in the face, presently. Meantime,
I gather what part of the great Greek story of the Sea
Angels, has meaning for us here.</p>

<p>Nereus, the God of the Sea, who dwells in it always (Neptune
being the God who rules it from Olympus), has children by
the Earth; namely, Thaumas, the father of Iris; that is, the
&ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; or miracle-working angel of the sea; Phorcys, the
malignant angel of it (you will find him degraded through many
forms, at last, in the story of Sindbad, into the Old Man of the
Sea); Ceto, the deep places of the sea, meaning its bays among
rocks, therefore called by Hesiod &ldquo;Fair-cheeked&rdquo; Ceto; and
Eurybia, the tidal force or sway of the sea, of whom more hereafter.</p>

<p>§ 10. Phorcys and Ceto, the malignant angel of the sea, and
the spirit of its deep rocky places, have children, namely, first,
Graiæ, the soft rain-clouds. The Greeks had a greater dislike
of storm than we have, and therefore whatever violence is in the
action of rain, they represented by harsher types than we should&mdash;types
given in one group by Aristophanes (speaking in mockery
of the poets): &ldquo;This was the reason, then, that they made
so much talk about the fierce rushing of the moist clouds, coiled
in glittering; and the locks of the hundred-headed Typhon;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
and the blowing storms; and the bent-clawed birds drifted on
the breeze, fresh, and aërial.&rdquo; Note the expression &ldquo;bent-clawed
birds.&rdquo; It illustrates two characters of these clouds; partly
their coiling form; but more directly the way they tear down
the earth from the hill-sides; especially those twisted storm-clouds
which in violent action become the waterspout. These
always strike at a narrow point, often opening the earth on a
hill-side into a trench as a great pickaxe would (whence the
Graiæ are said to have only one beak between them). Nevertheless,
the rain-cloud was, on the whole, looked upon by the
Greeks as beneficent, so that it is boasted of in the &OElig;dipus Coloneus
for its perpetual feeding of the springs of Cephisus,<a name="fa4o" id="fa4o" href="#ft4o"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and
elsewhere often; and the opening song of the rain-clouds in
Aristophanes is entirely beautiful:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O eternal Clouds! let us raise into open sight our dewy
existence, from the deep-sounding Sea, our Father, up to the
crests of the wooded hills, whence we look down over the sacred
land, nourishing its fruits, and over the rippling of the divine
rivers, and over the low murmuring bays of the deep.&rdquo; I cannot
satisfy myself about the meaning of the names of the Graiæ&mdash;Pephredo
and Enuo&mdash;but the epithets which Hesiod gives them
are interesting: &ldquo;Pephredo, the well-robed; Enuo, the crocus-robed;&rdquo;
probably, it seems to me, from their beautiful colors in
morning.</p>

<p>§ 11. Next to the Graiæ, Phorcys and Ceto begat the Gorgons,
which are the true storm-clouds. The Graiæ have only
one beak or tooth, but all the Gorgons have tusks like boars;
brazen hands (brass being the word used for the metal of which
the Greeks made their spears), and golden wings.</p>

<p>Their names are &ldquo;Steino&rdquo; (straitened), of storms compressed
into narrow compass; &ldquo;Euryale&rdquo; (having wide threshing-floor),
of storms spread over great space; &ldquo;Medusa&rdquo; (the dominant),
the most terrible. She is essentially the highest storm-cloud;
therefore the hail-cloud or cloud of cold, her countenance turning
all who behold it to stone. (&ldquo;He casteth forth his ice like
morsels. Who can stand before his cold?&rdquo;) The serpents about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
her head are the fringes of the hail, the idea of coldness being
connected by the Greeks with the bite of the serpent, as with the
hemlock.</p>

<p>§ 12. On Minerva&rsquo;s shield, her head signifies, I believe, the
cloudy coldness of knowledge, and its venomous character
(&ldquo;Knowledge puffeth up.&rdquo; Compare Bacon in Advancement of
Learning). But the idea of serpents rose essentially from the
change of form in the cloud as it broke; the cumulus cloud not
breaking into full storm till it is cloven by the cirrus; which is
twice hinted at in the story of Perseus; only we must go back a
little to gather it together.</p>

<p>Perseus was the son of Jupiter by Danaë, who being shut in
a brazen tower, Jupiter came to her in a shower of gold: the
brazen tower being, I think, only another expression for the
cumulus or Medusa cloud; and the golden rain for the rays of
the sun striking it; but we have not only this rain of Danaë&rsquo;s to
remember in connection with the Gorgon, but that also of the
sieves of the Danaïdes, said to represent the provision of Argos
with water by their father Danaüs, who dug wells about the
Acropolis; nor only wells, but opened, I doubt not, channels of
irrigation for the fields, because the Danaïdes are said to have
brought the mysteries of Ceres from Egypt. And though I cannot
trace the root of the names Danaüs and Danaë, there is
assuredly some farther link of connection in the deaths of the
lovers of the Danaïdes, whom they slew, as Perseus Medusa.
And again note, that when the father of Danaë, Acrisius, is
detained in Seriphos by storms, a disk thrown by Perseus is carried
<i>by the wind against his head</i>, and kills him; and lastly,
when Perseus cuts off the head of Medusa, from her blood
springs Chrysaor, &ldquo;wielder of the golden sword,&rdquo; the Angel of
the Lightning, and Pegasus, the Angel of the &ldquo;Wild Fountains,&rdquo;
that is to say, the fastest flying or lower rain-cloud;
winged, but racing as upon the earth.</p>

<p>§ 13. I say, &ldquo;wild&rdquo; fountains; because the kind of fountain
from which Pegasus is named is especially the &ldquo;fountain of the
great deep&rdquo; of Genesis; sudden and furious, (cataracts of
heaven, not windows, in the Septuagint);&mdash;the mountain torrent
caused by thunderous storm, or as our &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;&mdash;a Geyser-like
leaping forth of water. Therefore, it is the deep and full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
source of streams, and so used typically of the source of evils, or
of passions; whereas the word &ldquo;spring&rdquo; with the Greeks is like
our &ldquo;well-head&rdquo;&mdash;a gentle issuing forth of water continually.
But, because both the lightning-fire and the gushing forth, as of
a fountain, are the signs of the poet&rsquo;s true power, together with
perpetuity, it is Pegasus who strikes the earth with his foot, on
Helicon,<a name="fa5o" id="fa5o" href="#ft5o"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and causes Hippocrene to spring forth&mdash;&ldquo;the horse&rsquo;s
well-head.&rdquo; It is perpetual; but has, nevertheless, the Pegasean
storm-power.</p>

<p>§ 14. Wherein we may find, I think, sufficient cause for putting
honor upon the rain-cloud. Few of us, perhaps, have
thought, in watching its career across our own mossy hills, or
listening to the murmur of the springs amidst the mountain
quietness, that the chief masters of the human imagination owed,
and confessed that they owed, the force of their noblest thoughts,
not to the flowers of the valley, nor the majesty of the hill, but
to the flying cloud.</p>

<p>Yet they never saw it fly, as we may in our own England. So
far, at least, as I know the clouds of the south, they are often
more terrible than ours, but the English Pegasus is swifter. On
the Yorkshire and Derbyshire hills, when the rain-cloud is low
and much broken, and the steady west-wind fills all space with
its strength,<a name="fa6o" id="fa6o" href="#ft6o"><span class="sp">6</span></a> the sun-gleams fly like golden vultures: they are
flashes rather than shinings; the dark spaces and the dazzling
race and skim along the acclivities, and dart and dip from crag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
to dell, swallow-like;&mdash;no Graiæ these,&mdash;gray and withered:
Grey Hounds rather, following the Cerinthian stag with the
golden antlers.</p>

<p>§ 15. There is one character about these lower rain-clouds,
partly affecting all their connection with the upper sky, which I
have never been able to account for; that which, as before
noticed, Aristophanes fastened on at once for their distinctive
character&mdash;their obliquity. They always fly in an oblique position,
as in the Plate opposite, which is a careful facsimile of the
first advancing mass of the rain-cloud in Turner&rsquo;s Slave Ship.
When the head of the cloud is foremost, as in this instance, and
rain falling beneath, it is easy to imagine that its drops, increasing
in size as they fall, may exercise some retarding action on the
wind. But the head of the cloud is not always first, the base of
it is sometimes advanced.<a name="fa7o" id="fa7o" href="#ft7o"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The only certainty is, that it will
not shape itself horizontally, its thin drawn lines and main contours
will always be oblique, though its motion is horizontal;
and, which is still more curious, their sloping lines are hardly
ever modified in their descent by any distinct retiring tendency
or perspective convergence. A troop of leaning clouds will follow
one another, each stooping forward at the same apparent slope,
round a fourth of the horizon.</p>

<p>§ 16. Another circumstance which the reader should note in
this cloud of Turner&rsquo;s, is the witch-like look of drifted or
erected locks of hair at its left side. We have just read the words
of the old Greek poet: &ldquo;Locks of the hundred-headed Typhon;&rdquo;
and must remember that Turner&rsquo;s account of this picture, in the
Academy catalogue, was &ldquo;Slaver throwing overboard the Dead
and Dying. <i>Typhoon</i> coming on.&rdquo; The resemblance to wildly
drifted hair is stronger in the picture than in the engraving;
the gray and purple tints of torn cloud being relieved against
golden sky beyond.</p>

<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:690px; height:565px" src="images/img211.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">72. The Locks of Typhon.</td></tr></table>

<p>§ 17. It was not, however, as we saw, merely to locks of hair,
but to serpents, that the Greeks likened the dissolving of the
Medusa cloud in blood. Of that sanguine rain, or of its meaning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
I cannot yet speak. It is connected with other and higher
types, which must be traced in another place.<a name="fa8o" id="fa8o" href="#ft8o"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>But the likeness to serpents we may illustrate here. The two
Plates already given, 70 and 71 (at page 127), represent successive
conditions of the Medusa cloud on one of the Cenis hills
(the great limestone precipice above St. Michel, between Lanslebourg
and St. Jean di Maurienne).<a name="fa9o" id="fa9o" href="#ft9o"><span class="sp">9</span></a> In the first, the cloud is
approaching, with the lee-side cloud forming beyond it; in the
second, it has approached, increased, and broken, the Medusa
serpents writhing about the central peak, the rounded tops of
the broken cumulus showing above. In this instance, they
take nearly the forms of flame; but when the storm is more
violent, they are torn into fragments, and magnificent revolving
wheels of vapor are formed, broken, and tossed into the air,
as the grass is tossed in the hay-field from the toothed wheels
of the mowing-machine; perhaps, in common with all other
inventions of the kind, likely to bring more evil upon men than
ever the Medusa cloud did, and turn them more effectually into
stone.<a name="fa10o" id="fa10o" href="#ft10o"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>§ 18. I have named in the first volume the principal works
of Turner representing these clouds; and until I am able to
draw them better, it is useless to say more of them; but in connection
with the subject we have been examining, I should be
glad if the reader could turn to the engravings of the England
drawings of Salisbury and Stonehenge. What opportunities
Turner had of acquainting himself with classical literature, and
how he used them, we shall see presently. In the meantime, let
me simply assure the reader that, in various byways, he had gained
a knowledge of most of the great Greek traditions, and that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
felt them more than he knew them; his mind being affected, up
to a certain point, precisely as an ancient painter&rsquo;s would have
been, by external phenomena of nature. To him, as to the
Greek, the storm-clouds seemed messengers of fate. He feared
them, while he reverenced; nor does he ever introduce them
without some hidden purpose, bearing upon the expression of
the scene he is painting.</p>

<p>§ 19. On that plain of Salisbury, he had been struck first by
its widely-spacious pastoral life; and secondly, by its monuments
of the two great religions of England&mdash;Druidical and Christian.</p>

<p>He was not a man to miss the possible connection of these
impressions. He treats the shepherd life as a type of the ecclesiastical;
and composes his two drawings so as to illustrate both.</p>

<p>In the drawing of Salisbury, the plain is swept by rapid but
not distressful rain. The cathedral occupies the centre of the
picture, towering high over the city, of which the houses (made
on purpose smaller than they really are) are scattered about it
like a flock of sheep. The cathedral is surrounded by a great
light. The storm gives way at first in a subdued gleam over a
distant parish church, then bursts down again, breaks away into
full light about the cathedral, and passes over the city, in various
sun and shade. In the foreground stands a shepherd leaning on
his staff, watching his flock&mdash;bare-headed; he has given his cloak
to a group of children, who have covered themselves up with it,
and are shrinking from the rain; his dog crouches under a bank;
his sheep, for the most part, are resting quietly, some coming up
the slope of the bank towards him.<a name="fa11o" id="fa11o" href="#ft11o"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p>§ 20. The rain-clouds in this picture are wrought with a care
which I have never seen equalled in any other sky of the same
kind. It is the rain of blessing&mdash;abundant, but full of brightness;
golden gleams are flying across the wet grass, and fall softly
on the lines of willows in the valley&mdash;willows by the watercourses;
the little brooks flash out here and there between them and the
fields. Turn now to the Stonehenge. That, also, stands in great
light; but it is the Gorgon light&mdash;the sword of Chrysaor is bared
against it. The cloud of judgment hangs above. The rock pillars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
seem to reel before its slope, pale beneath the lightning.
And nearer, in the darkness, the shepherd lies dead, his flock
scattered.</p>

<p>I alluded, in speaking before of this Stonehenge, to Turner&rsquo;s
use of the same symbol in the drawing of Pæstum for Rogers&rsquo;s
Italy; but a more striking instance of its employment occurs in
a Study of Pæstum, which he engraved himself before undertaking
the Liber Studiorum and another in his drawing of the Temple of
Minerva, on Cape Colonna: and observe farther that he rarely
introduces lightning, if the ruined building has not been devoted
to religion. The wrath of man may destroy the fortress, but only
the wrath of heaven can destroy the temple.</p>

<p>§ 21. Of these secret meanings of Turner&rsquo;s, we shall see enough
in the course of the inquiry we have to undertake, lastly, respecting
ideas of relation; but one more instance of his opposed use
of the lightning symbol, and of the rain of blessing, I name here,
to confirm what has been noted above. For, in this last instance,
he was questioned respecting his meaning, and explained it. I
refer to the drawings of Sinai and Lebanon, made for Finden&rsquo;s
Bible. The sketches from which Turner prepared that series
were, I believe, careful and accurate; but the treatment of the
subjects was left wholly to him. He took the Sinai and Lebanon
to show the opposite influences of the Law and the Gospel.
The Rock of Moses is shown in the burning of the desert, among
fallen stones, forked lightning cleaving the blue mist which veils
the summit of Sinai. Armed Arabs pause at the foot of the
rock. No human habitation is seen, nor any herb or tree, nor
any brook, and the lightning strikes without rain.<a name="fa12o" id="fa12o" href="#ft12o"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Over the
Mount Lebanon an intensely soft gray-blue sky is melting into
dewy rain. Every ravine is filled, every promontory crowned,
by tenderest foliage, golden in slanting sunshine.<a name="fa13o" id="fa13o" href="#ft13o"><span class="sp">13</span></a> The white
convent nestles into the hollow of the rock; and a little brook
runs under the shadow of the nearer trees, beside which two
monks sit reading.</p>

<p>§ 22. It was a beautiful thought, yet an erring one, as all
thoughts are which oppose the Law to the Gospel. When people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
read, &ldquo;the law came by Moses, but grace and truth by
Christ,&rdquo; do they suppose that the law was ungracious and untrue?
The law was given for a foundation; the grace (or mercy)
and truth for fulfilment;&mdash;the whole forming one glorious
Trinity of judgment, mercy, and truth. And if people would
but read the text of their Bibles with heartier purpose of understanding
it, instead of superstitiously, they would see that
throughout the parts which they are intended to make most personally
their own (the Psalms) it is always the Law which is
spoken of with chief joy. The Psalms respecting mercy are often
sorrowful, as in thought of what it cost; but those respecting the
law are always full of delight. David cannot contain himself for
joy in thinking of it,&mdash;he is never weary of its praise:&mdash;&ldquo;How
love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. Thy testimonies
are my delight and my counsellors; sweeter, also, than honey and
the honeycomb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 23. And I desire, especially, that the reader should note
this, in now closing the work through which we have passed
together in the investigation of the beauty of the visible world.
For perhaps he expected more pleasure and freedom in that
work; he thought that it would lead him at once into fields of
fond imagination, and may have been surprised to find that the
following of beauty brought him always under a sterner dominion
of mysterious law; the brightness was continually based upon
obedience, and all majesty only another form of submission.
But this is indeed so. I have been perpetually hindered in this
inquiry into the sources of beauty by fear of wearying the
reader with their severities. It was always accuracy I had to ask
of him, not sympathy; patience, not zeal; apprehension, not
sensation. The thing to be shown him was not a pleasure to be
snatched, but a law to be learned.</p>

<p>§ 24. It is in this character, however, that the beauty of the
natural world completes its message. We saw long ago, how its
various <i>powers</i> of appeal to the mind of men might be traced to
some typical expression of Divine attributes. We have seen since
how its <i>modes</i> of appeal present constant types of human obedience
to the Divine law, and constant proofs that this law, instead
of being contrary to mercy, is the foundation of all delight, and
the guide of all fair and fortunate existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span></p>

<p>§ 25. Which understanding, let us receive our last message
from the Angel of the Sea.</p>

<p>Take up the 19th Psalm and look at it verse by verse. Perhaps
to my younger readers, one word may be permitted respecting
their Bible-reading in general.<a name="fa14o" id="fa14o" href="#ft14o"><span class="sp">14</span></a> The Bible is, indeed, a deep
book, when depth is required, that is to say, for deep people.
But it is not intended, particularly, for profound persons; on the
contrary, much more for shallow and simple persons. And therefore
the first, and generally the main and leading idea of the
Bible, is on its surface, written in plainest possible Greek,
Hebrew, or English, needing no penetration, nor amplification,
needing nothing but what we all might give&mdash;attention.</p>

<p>But this, which is in every one&rsquo;s power, and is the only thing
that God wants, is just the last thing any one will give Him.
We are delighted to ramble away into day-dreams, to repeat pet
verses from other places, suggested by chance words; to snap at
an expression which suits our own particular views, or to dig up
a meaning from under a verse, which we should be amiably
grieved to think any human being had been so happy as to find
before. But the plain, intended, immediate, fruitful meaning,
which every one ought to find always, and especially that which
depends on our seeing the relation of the verse to those near it,
and getting the force of the whole passage, in due relation&mdash;this
sort of significance we do not look for;&mdash;it being, truly, not to
be discovered, unless we really attend to what is said, instead of
to our own feelings.</p>

<p>§ 26. It is unfortunate also, but very certain, that in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
attend to what is said, we must go through the irksomeness of
knowing the meaning of the words. And the first thing that
children should be taught about their Bibles is, to distinguish
clearly between words that they understand and words that they
do not; and to put aside the words they do not understand, and
verses connected with them, to be asked about, or for a future
time; and never to think they are reading the Bible when they
are merely repeating phrases of an unknown tongue.</p>

<p>§ 27. Let us try, by way of example, this 19th Psalm, and see
what plain meaning is uppermost in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What are the heavens?</p>

<p>The word occurring in the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and the thing expressed
being what a child may, with some advantage, be led to
look at, it might be supposed among a schoolmaster&rsquo;s first duties
to explain this word clearly.</p>

<p>Now there can be no question that in the minds of the sacred
writers, it stood naturally for the entire system of cloud, and of
space beyond it, conceived by them as a vault set with stars. But
there can, also, be no question, as we saw in previous inquiry,
that the firmament, which is said to have been &ldquo;called&rdquo; heaven,
at the creation, expresses, in all definite use of the word, the system
of clouds, as spreading the power of the water over the earth;
hence the constant expressions dew of heaven, rain of heaven,
&amp;c., where heaven is used in the singular; while &ldquo;the heavens,&rdquo;
when used plurally, and especially when in distinction, as here,
from the word &ldquo;firmament,&rdquo; remained expressive of the starry
space beyond.</p>

<p>§ 28. A child might therefore be told (surely, with advantage),
that our beautiful word Heaven may possibly have been formed
from a Hebrew word, meaning &ldquo;the high place;&rdquo; that the great
warrior Roman nation, camping much out at night, generally
overtired and not in moods for thinking, are believed, by many
people, to have seen in the stars only the likeness of the glittering
studs of their armor, and to have called the sky &ldquo;The bossed, or
studded;&rdquo; but that others think those Roman soldiers on their
might-watches had rather been impressed by the great emptiness
and void of night, and by the far coming of sounds through its
darkness, and had called the heaven &ldquo;The Hollow place.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
Finally, I should tell the children, showing them first the setting
of a star, how the great Greeks had found out the truest power
of the heavens, and had called them &ldquo;The Rolling.&rdquo; But whatever
different nations had called them, at least I would make it
clear to the child&rsquo;s mind that in this 19th Psalm, their whole
power being intended, the two words are used which express it:
the Heavens, for the great vault or void, with all its planets, and
stars, and ceaseless march of orbs innumerable; and the Firmament,
for the ordinance of the clouds.</p>

<p>These heavens, then, &ldquo;declare the <i>glory</i> of God;&rdquo; that is, the
light of God, the eternal glory, stable and changeless. As their
orbs fail not&mdash;but pursue their course for ever, to give light upon
the earth&mdash;so God&rsquo;s glory surrounds man for ever&mdash;changeless, in
its fulness insupportable&mdash;infinite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the firmament showeth his <i>handywork</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 29. The clouds, prepared by the hand of God for the help
of man, varied in their ministration&mdash;veiling the inner splendor&mdash;show,
not His eternal glory, but His daily handiwork. So He
dealt with Moses. I will cover thee &ldquo;with my hand&rdquo; as I pass
by. Compare Job xxxvi. 24: &ldquo;Remember that thou magnify
his work, which men behold. Every man may see it.&rdquo; Not so
the glory&mdash;that only in part; the courses of these stars are to be
seen imperfectly, and but by a few. But this firmament, &ldquo;every
man may see it, man may behold it afar off.&rdquo; &ldquo;Behold, God is
great, and we know him not. For he maketh small the drops of
water: they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 30. &ldquo;Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
showeth knowledge. They have no speech nor language, yet
without these their voice is heard. Their rule is gone out throughout
the earth, and their words to the end of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note that. Their rule throughout the earth, whether inhabited
or not&mdash;their law of right is thereon; but their words,
spoken to human souls, to the end of the inhabited world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,&rdquo; &amp;c. Literally,
a tabernacle, or curtained tent, with its veil and its hangings;
also of the colors of His desert tabernacle&mdash;blue, and purple, and
scarlet.</p>

<p>Thus far the psalm describes the manner of this great heaven&rsquo;s
message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span></p>

<p>Thenceforward, it comes to the matter of it.</p>

<p>§ 31. Observe, you have the two divisions of the declaration.
The heavens (compare Psalm viii.) declare the eternal glory of
God before men, and the firmament the daily mercy of God towards
men. And the eternal glory is in this&mdash;that the law of the
Lord is perfect, and His testimony sure, and His statutes right.</p>

<p>And the daily mercy in this&mdash;that the commandment of the
Lord is pure, and His fear is clean, and His judgments true and
righteous.</p>

<p>There are three oppositions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Between law and commandment.</p>

<p>Between testimony and fear.</p>

<p>Between statute and judgment.</p>

<p>§ 32. I. Between law and commandment.</p>

<p>The law is fixed and everlasting; uttered once, abiding for
ever, as the sun, it may not be moved. It is &ldquo;perfect, converting
the soul:&rdquo; the whole question about the soul being, whether
it has been turned from darkness to light, acknowledged this law
or not,&mdash;whether it is godly or ungodly? But the commandment
is given momentarily to each man, according to the need.
It does not convert: it guides. It does not concern the entire
purpose of the soul; but it enlightens the eyes, respecting a
special act. The law is, &ldquo;Do this always;&rdquo; the commandment,
&ldquo;Do <i>thou</i> this <i>now</i>:&rdquo; often mysterious enough, and through the
cloud; chilling, and with strange rain of tears; yet always pure
(the law converting, but the commandment cleansing): a rod
not for guiding merely, but for strengthening, and tasting honey
with. &ldquo;Look how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
tasted a little of this honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 33. II. Between testimony and fear.</p>

<p>The testimony is everlasting: the true promise of salvation.
Bright as the sun beyond all the earth-cloud, it makes wise the
simple; all wisdom being assured in perceiving it and trusting it;
all wisdom brought to nothing which does not perceive it.</p>

<p>But the fear of God is taught through special encouragement
and special withdrawal of it, according to each man&rsquo;s need&mdash;by
the earth-cloud&mdash;smile and frown alternately: it also, as the
commandment, is clean, purging and casting out all other fear,
it only remaining for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span></p>

<p>§ 34. III. Between statute and judgment.</p>

<p>The statutes are the appointments of the Eternal justice;
fixed and bright, and constant as the stars; equal and balanced
as their courses. They &ldquo;are right, rejoicing the heart.&rdquo; But
the judgments are special judgments of given acts of men.
&ldquo;True,&rdquo; that is to say, fulfilling the warning or promise given
to each man; &ldquo;righteous altogether,&rdquo; that is, done or executed
in truth and righteousness. The statute is right, in appointment.
The judgment righteous altogether, in appointment and
fulfilment;&mdash;yet not always rejoicing the heart.</p>

<p>Then, respecting all these, comes the expression of passionate
desire, and of joy; that also divided with respect to each. The
glory of God, eternal in the Heavens, is future, &ldquo;to be <i>desired</i>
more than gold, than much fine gold&rdquo;&mdash;treasure in the heavens
that faileth not. But the present guidance and teaching of God
are on earth; they are now possessed, sweeter than all earthly
food&mdash;&ldquo;sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by
them&rdquo; (the law and the testimony) &ldquo;is thy servant warned&rdquo;&mdash;warned
of the ways of death and life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in keeping them&rdquo; (the commandments and the judgments)
&ldquo;there is great reward:&rdquo; pain now, and bitterness of
tears, but reward unspeakable.</p>

<p>§ 35. Thus far the psalm has been descriptive and interpreting.
It ends in prayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can understand his errors?&rdquo; (wanderings from the
perfect law.) &ldquo;Cleanse thou me from secret faults; from all
that I have done against thy will, and far from thy way, in the
darkness. Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins&rdquo;
(sins against the commandment) &ldquo;against thy will when it is
seen and direct, pleading with heart and conscience. So shall I
be undefiled, and innocent from the great transgression&mdash;the
transgression that crucifies afresh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the words of my mouth (for I have set them to declare
thy law), and the meditation of my heart (for I have set it to
keep thy commandments), be acceptable in thy sight, whose
glory is my strength, and whose work, my redemption; my
Strength, and my Redeemer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft2o" id="ft2o" href="#fa2o"><span class="fn">2</span></a> I do not mean that Correggio is greater than Turner, but that only <i>his</i>
way of work, the touch which he has used for the golden hair of Antiope
for instance, could have painted these clouds. In open lowland country I
have never been able to come to any satisfactory conclusion about their
height, so strangely do they blend with each other. Here, for instance, is
the arrangement of an actual group of them. The space at <span class="scs">A</span> was deep,
purest ultramarine blue, traversed by streaks of absolutely pure and perfect
rose-color. The blue passed downwards imperceptibly into gray at <span class="scs">G</span>, and
then into amber, and at the white edge below into gold. On this amber
ground the streaks <span class="scs">P</span> were dark purple, and, finally, the spaces at <span class="scs">B</span> <span class="scs">B</span>, again,
clearest and most precious blue, paler than that at <span class="scs">A</span>. The <i>two</i> levels of
these clouds are always very notable. After a continuance of fine weather
among the Alps, the determined approach of rain is usually announced by
a soft, unbroken film of level cloud, white and thin at the approaching edge,
gray at the horizon, covering the whole sky from side to side, and advancing
steadily from the south-west. Under its gray veil, as it approaches, are
formed detached bars, darker or lighter than the field above, according to
the position of the sun. These bars are usually of a very sharply elongated
oval shape, something like fish. I habitually call them &ldquo;fish clouds,&rdquo; and
look upon them with much discomfort, if any excursions of interest have
been planned within the next three days. Their oval shape is a perspective
deception dependent on their flatness; they are probably thin, extended
fields, irregularly circular.</p>

expression of the very heart and meaning of wind, there is no place like a
Yorkshire moor. I think Scottish breezes are thinner, very bleak and piercing,
but not substantial. If you lean on them they will let you fall, but one
may rest against a Yorkshire breeze as one would on a quickset hedge. I
shall not soon forget,&mdash;having had the good fortune to meet a vigorous one

the teacher professes to impress his audience by showing &ldquo;how much there
is in a verse.&rdquo; If he examined his own heart closely before beginning, he
would often find that his real desire was to show how much he, the expounder,
could make out of the verse. But entirely honest and earnest men
often fall into the same error. They have been taught that they should
always look deep, and that Scripture is full of hidden meanings; and they
easily yield to the flattering conviction that every chance idea which comes
into their heads in looking at a word, is put there by Divine agency.
Hence they wander away into what they believe to be an inspired meditation,
but which is, in reality, a meaningless jumble of ideas; perhaps very
proper ideas, but with which the text in question has nothing whatever
to do.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE LAW OF HELP.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. We</span> have now reached the last and the most important
part of our subject. We have seen, in the first division of this
book, how far art may be, and has been, consistent with physical or
material facts. In its second division, we examined how far it
may be and has been obedient to the laws of physical beauty.
In this last division we have to consider its relations of art to
God and man. Its work in the help of human beings, and service
of their Creator.</p>

<p>We have to inquire into the various Powers, Conditions, and
Aims of mind involved in the conception or creation of pictures;
in the choice of subject, and the mode and order of its history;&mdash;the
choice of forms, and the modes of their arrangement.</p>

<p>And these phases of mind being concerned, partly with
choice and arrangement of incidents, partly with choice and
arrangement of forms and colors, the whole subject will fall into
two main divisions, namely, expressional or spiritual invention;
and material or formal invention.</p>

<p>They are of course connected;&mdash;all good formal invention
being expressional also; but as a matter of convenience it is best
to say what may be ascertained of the nature of formal invention,
before attempting to illustrate the faculty in its higher
field.</p>

<p>§ 2. First, then, of <span class="sc">Invention Formal</span>, otherwise and most
commonly called technical composition; that is to say, the arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
of lines, forms, or colors, so as to produce the best
possible effect.<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>I have often been accused of slighting this quality in pictures;
the fact being that I have avoided it only because I considered
it too great and wonderful for me to deal with. The
longer I thought, the more wonderful it always seemed; and it
is, to myself personally, the quality, above all others, which
gives me delight in pictures. Many others I admire, or respect;
but this one I rejoice in. Expression, sentiment, truth to nature,
are essential; but all these are not enough. I never care to look
at a picture again, if it be ill composed; and if well composed I
can hardly leave off looking at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well composed.&rdquo; Does that mean according to rule?</p>

<p>No. Precisely the contrary. Composed as only the man who
did it could have done it; composed as no other picture is, or
was, or ever can be again. Every great work stands alone.</p>

<p>§ 3. Yet there are certain elementary laws of arrangement
traceable a little way; a few of these only I shall note, not caring
to pursue the subject far in this work, so intricate it becomes
even in its first elements: nor could it be treated with any approach
to completeness, unless I were to give many and elaborate
outlines of large pictures. I have a vague hope of entering on
such a task, some future day. Meantime I shall only indicate
the place which technical composition should hold in our
scheme.</p>

<p>And, first, let us understand what composition is, and how
far it is required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span></p>

<p>§ 4. Composition may be best defined as the help of everything
in the picture by everything else.</p>

<p>I wish the reader to dwell a little on this word &ldquo;Help.&rdquo; It
is a grave one.</p>

<p>In substance which we call &ldquo;inanimate,&rdquo; as of clouds, or
stones, their atoms may cohere to each other, or consist with
each other, but they do not help each other. The removal of
one part does not injure the rest.</p>

<p>But in a plant, the taking away of any one part does injure
the rest. Hurt or remove any portion of the sap, bark, or pith,
the rest is injured. If any part enters into a state in which it no
more assists the rest, and has thus become &ldquo;helpless,&rdquo; we call it
also &ldquo;dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The power which causes the several portions of the plant to
help each other, we call life. Much more is this so in an animal.
We may take away the branch of a tree without much harm to
it; but not the animal&rsquo;s limb. Thus, intensity of life is also
intensity of helpfulness&mdash;completeness of depending of each part
on all the rest. The ceasing of this help is what we call corruption;
and in proportion to the perfectness of the help, is the
dreadfulness of the loss. The more intense the life has been, the
more terrible is its corruption.</p>

<p>The decomposition of a crystal is not necessarily impure at
all. The fermentation of a wholesome liquid begins to admit
the idea slightly; the decay of leaves yet more; of flowers, more;
of animals, with greater painfulness and terribleness in exact proportion
to their original vitality; and the foulest of all corruption
is that of the body of man; and, in his body, that which is
occasioned by disease, more than that of natural death.</p>

<p>§ 5. I said just now, that though atoms of inanimate substance
could not help each other, they could &ldquo;consist&rdquo; with each
other. &ldquo;Consistence&rdquo; is their virtue. Thus the parts of a crystal
are consistent, but of dust, inconsistent. Orderly adherence,
the best help its atoms can give, constitutes the nobleness of such
substance.</p>

<p>When matter is either consistent, or living, we call it pure,
or clean; when inconsistent, or corrupting (unhelpful), we call
it impure, or unclean. The greatest uncleanliness being that
which is essentially most opposite to life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span></p>

<p>Life and consistency, then, both expressing one character
(namely, helpfulness, of a higher or lower order), the Maker of
all creatures and things, &ldquo;by whom all creatures live, and all
things consist,&rdquo; is essentially and for ever the Helpful One, or in
softer Saxon, the &ldquo;Holy&rdquo; One.</p>

<p>The word has no other ultimate meaning: Helpful, harmless,
undefiled: &ldquo;living&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea is clear and mighty in the cherubim&rsquo;s cry: &ldquo;Helpful,
helpful, helpful, Lord God of Hosts;&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of all the hosts,
armies, and creatures of the earth.<a name="fa2p" id="fa2p" href="#ft2p"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>§ 6. A pure or holy state of anything, therefore, is that in
which all its parts are helpful or consistent. They may or may
not be homogeneous. The highest or organic purities are composed
of many elements in an entirely helpful state. The highest
and first law of the universe&mdash;and the other name of life, is,
therefore, &ldquo;help.&rdquo; The other name of death is &ldquo;separation.&rdquo;
Government and co-operation are in all things and eternally the
laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all
things, the laws of death.</p>

<p>§ 7. Perhaps the best, though the most familiar example we
could take of the nature and power of consistence, will be that
of the possible changes in the dust we tread on.</p>

<p>Exclusive of animal decay, we can hardly arrive at a more
absolute type of impurity than the mud or slime of a damp over-trodden
path, in the outskirts of a manufacturing town. I do
not say mud of the road, because that is mixed with animal
refuse; but take merely an ounce or two of the blackest slime
of a beaten footpath on a rainy day, near a large manufacturing
town.</p>

<p>§ 8. That slime we shall find in most cases composed of clay
(or brickdust, which is burnt clay) mixed with soot, a little sand,
and water. All these elements are at helpless war with each
other, and destroy reciprocally each other&rsquo;s nature and power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
competing and fighting for place at every tread of your foot;&mdash;sand
squeezing out clay, and clay squeezing out water, and soot
meddling everywhere and defiling the whole. Let us suppose
that this ounce of mud is left in perfect rest, and that its elements
gather together, like to like, so that their atoms may get
into the closest relations possible.</p>

<p>§ 9. Let the clay begin. Ridding itself of all foreign substance,
it gradually becomes a white earth, already very beautiful;
and fit, with help of congealing fire, to be made into finest porcelain,
and painted on, and be kept in kings&rsquo; palaces. But such
artificial consistence is not its best. Leave it still quiet to follow
its own instinct of unity, and it becomes not only white, but
clear; not only clear, but hard; not only clear and hard, but so
set that it can deal with light in a wonderful way, and gather
out of it the loveliest blue rays only, refusing the rest. We call
it then a sapphire.</p>

<p>Such being the consummation of the clay, we give similar
permission of quiet to the sand. It also becomes, first, a white
earth, then proceeds to grow clear and hard, and at last arranges
itself in mysterious, infinitely fine, parallel lines, which have the
power of reflecting not merely the blue rays, but the blue, green,
purple, and red rays in the greatest beauty in which they can be
seen through any hard material whatsoever. We call it then an
opal.</p>

<p>In next order the soot sets to work; it cannot make itself
white at first, but instead of being discouraged, tries harder and
harder, and comes out clear at last, and the hardest thing in the
world; and for the blackness that it had, obtains in exchange
the power of reflecting all the rays of the sun at once in the
vividest blaze that any solid thing can shoot. We call it then a
diamond.</p>

<p>Last of all the water purifies or unites itself, contented
enough if it only reach the form of a dew-drop; but if we insist
on its proceeding to a more perfect consistence, it crystallizes into
the shape of a star.</p>

<p>And for the ounce of slime which we had by political economy
of competition, we have by political economy of co-operation, a
sapphire, an opal, and a diamond, set in the midst of a star of
snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span></p>

<p>§ 10. Now invention in art signifies an arrangement, in
which everything in the work is thus consistent with all things
else, and helpful to all else.</p>

<p>It is the greatest and rarest of all the qualities of art. The
power by which it is effected is absolutely inexplicable and incommunicable;
but exercised with entire facility by those who
possess it, in many cases even unconsciously.<a name="fa3p" id="fa3p" href="#ft3p"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>In work which is not composed, there may be many beautiful
things, but they do not help each other. They at the best
only stand beside, and more usually compete with and destroy,
each other. They may be connected artificially in many ways,
but the test of there being no invention is, that if one of them
be taken away, the others are no worse than before. But in
true composition, if one be taken away, all the rest are helpless
and valueless. Generally, in falsely composed work, if anything
be taken away, the rest will look better; because the attention is
less distracted. Hence the pleasure of inferior artists in sketching,
and their inability to finish; all that they add destroys.</p>

<p>§ 11. Also in true composition, everything not only helps
everything else a <i>little</i>, but helps with its utmost power. Every
atom is in full energy; and <i>all</i> that energy is kind. Not a line,
nor spark of color, but is doing its very best, and that best is
aid. The extent to which this law is carried in truly right and
noble work is wholly inconceivable to the ordinary observer, and
no true account of it would be believed.</p>

<p>§ 12. True composition being entirely easy to the man who
can compose, he is seldom proud of it, though he clearly recognizes
it. Also, true composition is inexplicable. No one can
explain how the notes of a Mozart melody, or the folds of a piece
of Titian&rsquo;s drapery, produce their essential effect on each other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
If you do not feel it, no one can by reasoning make you feel it.
And, the highest composition is so subtle, that it is apt to become
unpopular, and sometimes seem insipid.</p>

<p>§ 13. The reader may be surprised at my giving so high a
place to invention. But if he ever come to know true invention
from false, he will find that it is not only the highest quality of
art, but is simply the most wonderful act or power of humanity.
It is pre-eminently the deed of human creation; <span class="grk" title="poiêsis">&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, otherwise,
poetry.</p>

<p>If the reader will look back to my definition of poetry, he will
find it is &ldquo;the suggestion, by the imagination, of noble grounds for
the noble emotions&rdquo; (Vol. III. p. 10), amplified below (§ 14) into
&ldquo;assembling by help of the imagination;&rdquo; that is to say, imagination
associative, described at length in Vol. II., in the chapter
just referred to. The mystery of the power is sufficiently set
forth in that place. Of its dignity I have a word or two to say
here.</p>

<p>§ 14. Men in their several professed employments, looked at
broadly, may be properly arranged under five classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Persons who see. These in modern language are sometimes
called sight-seers, that being an occupation coming more
and more into vogue every day. Anciently they used to be called,
simply, seers.</p>

<p>2. Persons who talk.  These, in modern language, are
usually called talkers, or speakers, as in the House of Commons,
and elsewhere. They used to be called prophets.</p>

<p>3. Persons who make. These, in modern language, are
usually called manufacturers. Anciently they were called poets.</p>

<p>4. Persons who think. There seems to be no very distinct
modern title for this kind of person, anciently called philosophers;
nevertheless we have a few of them among us.</p>

<p>5. Persons who do: in modern language, called practical persons;
anciently, believers.</p>

<p>Of the first two classes I have only this to note,&mdash;that we
ought neither to say that a person sees, if he sees falsely, nor
speaks, if he speaks falsely. For seeing falsely is worse than
blindness, and speaking falsely, than silence. A man who is too
dim-sighted to discern the road from the ditch, may feel which
is which;&mdash;but if the ditch appears manifestly to him to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
road, and the road to be the ditch, what shall become of him?
False seeing is unseeing,&mdash;on the negative side of blindness; and
false speaking, unspeaking,&mdash;on the negative side of silence.</p>

<p>To the persons who think, also, the same test applies very
shrewdly. Theirs is a dangerous profession; and from the time
of the Aristophanes thought-shop to the great German establishment,
or thought-manufactory, whose productions have, unhappily,
taken in part the place of the older and more serviceable
commodities of Nuremberg toys and Berlin wool, it has been
often harmful enough to mankind. It should not be so, for a
false thought is more distinctly and visibly no thought than a
false saying is no saying. But it is touching the two great productive
classes of the doers and makers, that we have one or two
important points to note here.</p>

<p>§ 15. Has the reader ever considered, carefully, what is the
meaning of &ldquo;doing&rdquo; a thing?</p>

<p>Suppose a rock falls from a hill-side, crushes a group of cottages,
and kills a number of people. The stone has produced a
great effect in the world. If any one asks, respecting the broken
roofs, &ldquo;What did it?&rdquo; you say the stone did it. Yet you don&rsquo;t
talk of the deed of the stone. If you inquire farther, and find
that a goat had been feeding beside the rock, and had loosened
it by gnawing the roots of the grasses beneath, you find the goat
to be the active cause of the calamity, and you say the goat did
it. Yet you don&rsquo;t call the goat the doer, nor talk of its evil
deed. But if you find any one went up to the rock, in the night,
and with deliberate purpose loosened it, that it might fall on the
cottages, you say in quite a different sense, &ldquo;It is his deed: he
is the doer of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 16. It appears, then, that deliberate purpose and resolve are
needed to constitute a deed or doing, in the true sense of the
word; and that when, accidentally or mechanically, events take
place without such purpose, we have indeed effects or results, and
agents or causes, but neither deeds nor doers.</p>

<p>Now it so happens, as we all well know, that by far the
largest part of things happening in practical life <i>are</i> brought
about with no deliberate purpose. There are always a number of
people who have the nature of stones; they fall on other persons
and crush them. Some again have the nature of weeds, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
twist about other people&rsquo;s feet and entangle them. More have
the nature of logs, and lie in the way, so that every one falls over
them. And most of all have the nature of thorns, and set themselves
by waysides, so that every passer-by must be torn, and all
good seed choked; or perhaps make wonderful crackling under
various pots, even to the extent of practically boiling water and
working pistons. All these people produce immense and sorrowful
effect in the world. Yet none of them are doers: it is their
nature to crush, impede, and prick: but deed is not in them.<a name="fa4p" id="fa4p" href="#ft4p"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>§ 17. And farther, observe, that even when some effect is
finally intended, you cannot call it the person&rsquo;s deed, unless it is
<i>what</i> he intended.</p>

<p>If an ignorant person, purposing evil, accidentally does good,
(as if a thief&rsquo;s disturbing a family should lead them to discover
in time that their house was on fire); or <i>vice versâ</i>, if an ignorant
person intending good, accidentally does evil (as if a child
should give hemlock to his companions for celery), in neither
case do you call them the doers of what may result. So that in
order to be a true deed, it is necessary that the effect of it should
be foreseen. Which, ultimately, it cannot be, but by a person
who knows, and in his deed obeys, the laws of the universe, and
of its Maker. And this knowledge is in its highest form, respecting
the will of the Ruling Spirit, called Trust. For it is
not the knowledge that a thing is, but that, according to the
promise and nature of the Ruling Spirit, a thing will be. Also
obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and
compulsory law, but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience
to an issued command; and so far as it was a <i>persuaded</i> submission
to command, it was anciently called, in a passive sense,
&ldquo;persuasion,&rdquo; or <span class="grk" title="pistis">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span>, and in so far as it alone assuredly did,
and it alone <i>could</i> do, what it meant to do, and was therefore the
root and essence of all human deed, it was called by the Latins
the &ldquo;doing,&rdquo; or <i>fides</i>, which has passed into the French <i>foi</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
the English <i>faith</i>. And therefore because in His doing always
certain, and in His speaking always true, His name who leads
the armies of Heaven is &ldquo;Faithful and True,&rdquo;<a name="fa5p" id="fa5p" href="#ft5p"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and all deeds
which are done in alliance with those armies, be they small or
great, are essentially deeds of faith, which therefore, and in this
one stern, eternal, sense, subdues all kingdoms, and turns to
flight the armies of the aliens, and is at once the source and the
substance of all human deed, rightly so called.</p>

<p>§ 18. Thus far then of practical persons, once called believers,
as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever,
so far as I know, uttered by simple man concerning his practice,
being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical
nation, whose deed thenceforward became an example of deed to
mankind:</p>

<p class="noind">&ldquo;O stranger! (we pray thee), tell the Lacedæmonians that we
are lying here, having <i>obeyed</i> their words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 19. What, let us ask next, is the ruling character of the
person who produces&mdash;the creator or maker, anciently called the
poet?</p>

<p>We have seen what a deed is. What then is a &ldquo;creation&rdquo;?
Nay, it may be replied, to &ldquo;create&rdquo; cannot be said of man&rsquo;s
labor.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it not only can be said, but is and must be
said continually. You certainly do not talk of creating a watch,
or creating a shoe; nevertheless you <i>do</i> talk of creating a feeling.
Why is this?</p>

<p>Look back to the greatest of all creation, that of the world.
Suppose the trees had been ever so well or so ingeniously put together,
stem and leaf, yet if they had not been able to grow,
would they have been well created? Or suppose the fish had been
cut and stitched finely out of skin and whalebone; yet, cast upon
the waters, had not been able to swim? Or suppose Adam and
Eve had been made in the softest clay, ever so neatly, and set at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
the foot of the tree of knowledge, fastened up to it, quite unable
to fall, or do anything else, would they have been well created,
or in any true sense created at all?</p>

<p>§ 20. It will, perhaps, appear to you, after a little farther
thought, that to create anything in reality is to put life into it.</p>

<p>A poet, or creator, is therefore a person who puts things together,
not as a watchmaker steel, or a shoemaker leather, but
who puts life into them.</p>

<p>His work is essentially this: it is the gathering and arranging
of material by imagination, so as to have in it at last the harmony
or helpfulness of life, and the passion or emotion of life.
Mere fitting and adjustment of material is nothing; that is
watchmaking. But helpful and passionate harmony, essentially
choral harmony, so called from the Greek word &ldquo;rejoicing,&rdquo;<a name="fa6p" id="fa6p" href="#ft6p"><span class="sp">6</span></a> is
the harmony of Apollo and the Muses; the word Muse and
Mother being derived from the same root, meaning &ldquo;passionate
seeking,&rdquo; or love, of which the issue is passionate finding, or
sacred <span class="scs">INVENTION</span>. For which reason I could not bear to use
any baser word than this of invention. And if the reader will
think over all these things, and follow them out, as I think he
may easily with this much of clue given him, he will not any
more think it wrong in me to place invention so high among the
powers of man.<a name="fa7p" id="fa7p" href="#ft7p"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>Or any more think it strange that the last act of the life of
Socrates<a name="fa8p" id="fa8p" href="#ft8p"><span class="sp">8</span></a> should have been to purify himself from the sin of
having negligently listened to the voice within him, which,
through all his past life, had bid him &ldquo;labor, and make harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1p" id="ft1p" href="#fa1p"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The word composition has been so much abused, and is in itself so inexpressive,
that when I wrote the first part of this work I intended always
to use, in this final section of it, the word &ldquo;invention,&rdquo; and to reserve the
term &ldquo;composition&rdquo; for that false composition which can be taught on
principles; as I have already so employed the term in the chapter on
&ldquo;Imagination Associative,&rdquo; in the second volume. But, in arranging this

parlance; I therefore only head the section as I intended (and as is, indeed,
best), using in the text the ordinarily accepted term; only, the reader must
be careful to note that what I spoke of shortly as &ldquo;composition&rdquo; in the
chapters on &ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; I here always call, distinctly, &ldquo;false composition;&rdquo;
using here, as I find most convenient, the words &ldquo;invention&rdquo; or
&ldquo;composition&rdquo; indifferently for the true faculty.</p>

so that the parts shall help each other, a little, or at all events do no
harm; and when some tact and taste are associated with this diligence, semblances
of real invention are often produced, which, being the results of
great labor, the artist is always proud of; and which, being capable of
learned explanation and imitation, the spectator naturally takes interest in.
The common precepts about composition all produce and teach this false

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE TASK OF THE LEAST.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. The</span> reader has probably been surprised at my assertions
made often before now, and reiterated here, that the <i>minutest</i>
portion of a great composition is helpful to the whole. It certainly
does not seem easily conceivable that this should be so. I will
go farther, and say that it is inconceivable. But it is the fact.</p>

<p>We shall discern it to be so by taking one or two compositions
to pieces, and examining the fragments. In doing which, we
must remember that a great composition always has a leading
emotional purpose, technically called its motive, to which all its
lines and forms have some relation. Undulating lines, for instance,
are expressive of action; and would be false in effect if
the motive of the picture was one of repose. Horizontal and
angular lines are expressive of rest and strength; and would
destroy a design whose purpose was to express disquiet and feebleness.
It is therefore necessary to ascertain the motive before
descending to the detail.</p>

<p>§ 2. One of the simplest subjects, in the series of the Rivers
of France, is &ldquo;Rietz, near Saumur.&rdquo; The published Plate gives
a better rendering than usual of its tone of light; and my rough
etching, Plate 73, sufficiently shows the arrangement of its lines.
What is their motive?</p>

<p>To get at it completely, we must know something of the
Loire.</p>

<p>The district through which it here flows is, for the most part,
a low place, yet not altogether at the level of the stream, but cut
into steep banks of chalk or gravel, thirty or forty feet high,
running for miles at about an equal height above the water.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:846px; height:572px" src="images/img236.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">73. Loire-side.</td></tr></table>

<p>These banks are excavated by the peasantry, partly for houses,
partly for cellars, so economizing vineyard space above; and thus
a kind of continuous village runs along the river-side, composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
half of caves, half of rude buildings, backed by the cliff, propped
against it, therefore always leaning away from the river; mingled
with overlappings of vineyard trellis from above, and little towers
or summer-houses for outlook, when the grapes are ripe, or for
gossip over the garden wall.</p>

<p>§ 3. It is an autumnal evening, then, by this Loire side.
The day has been hot, and the air is heavy and misty still; the
sunlight warm, but dim; the brown vine-leaves motionless: all
else quiet. Not a sail in sight on the river,<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> its strong, noiseless
current lengthening the stream of low sunlight.</p>

<p>The motive of the picture, therefore, is the expression of rude
but perfect peace, slightly mingled with an indolent languor and
despondency; the peace between intervals of enforced labor;
happy, but listless, and having little care or hope about the
future; cutting its home out of this gravel bank, and letting the
vine and the river twine and undermine as they will; careless to
mend or build, so long as the walls hold together, and the black
fruit swells in the sunshine.</p>

<p>§ 4. To get this repose, together with rude stability, we have
therefore horizontal lines and bold angles. The grand horizontal
space and sweep of Turner&rsquo;s distant river show perhaps better in
the etching than in the Plate; but depend wholly for value on
the piece of near wall. It is the vertical line of its dark side
which drives the eye up into the distance, right against the horizontal,
and so makes it felt, while the flatness of the stone prepares
the eye to understand the flatness of the river. Farther:
hide with your finger the little ring on that stone, and you will
find the river has stopped flowing. That ring is to repeat the
curved lines of the river bank, which express its line of current,
and to bring the feeling of them down near us. On the other
side of the road the horizontal lines are taken up again by the
dark pieces of wood, without which we should still lose half
our space.</p>

<p>Next: The repose is to be not only perfect, but indolent: the
repose of out-wearied people: not caring much what becomes of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span></p>

<p>You see the road is covered with litter. Even the crockery
is left outside the cottage to dry in the sun, after being washed
up. The steps of the cottage door have been too high for comfort
originally, only it was less trouble to cut three large stones
than four or five small. They are now all aslope and broken,
not repaired for years. Their weighty forms increase the sense
of languor throughout the scene, and of stability also, because we
feel how difficult it would be to stir them. The crockery has its
work to do also;&mdash;the arched door on the left being necessary to
show the great thickness of walls and the strength they require
to prevent falling in of the cliff above;&mdash;as the horizontal lines
must be diffused on the right, so this arch must be diffused on
the left; and the large round plate on one side of the steps, with
the two small ones on the other, are to carry down the element
of circular curvature. Hide them, and see the result.</p>

<p>As they carry the arched group of forms down, the arched
window-shutter diffuses it upwards, where all the lines of the
distant buildings suggest one and the same idea of disorderly and
careless strength, mingling masonry with rock.</p>

<p>§ 5. So far of the horizontal and curved lines. How of the
radiating ones? What has the black vine trellis got to do?</p>

<p>Lay a pencil or ruler parallel with its lines. You will find
that they point to the massive building in the distance. To
which, as nearly as is possible without at once showing the artifice,
every other radiating line points also; almost ludicrously
when it is once pointed out; even the curved line of the top of
the terrace runs into it, and the last sweep of the river evidently
leads to its base. And so nearly is it in the exact centre of the
picture, that one diagonal from corner to corner passes through
it, and the other only misses the base by the twentieth of an
inch.</p>

<p>If you are accustomed to France, you will know in a moment
by its outline that this massive building is an old church.</p>

<p>Without it, the repose would not have been essentially the
laborer&rsquo;s rest&mdash;rest as of the Sabbath. Among all the groups of
lines that point to it, two are principal: the first, those of the
vine trellis: the second, those of the handles of the saw left in
the beam:&mdash;the blessing of human life and its labor.</p>

<p>Whenever Turner wishes to express profound repose, he puts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
in the foreground some instrument of labor cast aside. See, in
Roger&rsquo;s Poems, the last vignette, &ldquo;Datur hora quieti,&rdquo; with the
plough in the furrow; and in the first vignette of the same book,
the scythe on the shoulder of the peasant going home. (There
is nothing about the scythe in the passage of the poem which
this vignette illustrates.)</p>

<p>§ 6. Observe, farther, the outline of the church itself. As
our habitations are, so is our church, evidently a heap of old, but
massive, walls, patched, and repaired, and roofed in, and over
and over, until its original shape is hardly recognizable. I know
the kind of church well&mdash;can tell even here, two miles off, that
I shall find some Norman arches in the apse, and a flamboyant
porch, rich and dark, with every statue broken out of it; and a
rude wooden belfry above all; and a quantity of miserable shops
built in among the buttresses; and that I may walk in and out
as much as I please, but that how often soever, I shall always find
some one praying at the Holy Sepulchre, in the darkest aisle,
and my going in and out will not disturb them. For they <i>are</i>
praying, which in many a handsomer and highlier-furbished edifice
might, perhaps, not be so assuredly the case.</p>

<p>§ 7. Lastly: What kind of people have we on this winding
road? Three indolent ones, leaning on the wall to look over into
the gliding water; and a matron with her market panniers, by
her figure, not a fast rider. The road, besides, is bad, and seems
unsafe for trotting, and she has passed without disturbing the
cat, who sits comfortably on the block of wood in the middle of
it.</p>

<p>§ 8. Next to this piece of quietness, let us glance at a composition
in which the motive is one of tumult: that of the Fall
of Schaffhausen. It is engraved in the Keepsake. I have etched
in Plate 74, at the top, the chief lines of its composition,<a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> in
which the first great purpose is to give swing enough to the
water. The line of fall is straight and monotonous in reality.
Turner wants to get the great concave sweep and rush of the
river well felt, in spite of the unbroken form. The column of
spray, rocks, mills, and bank, all radiate like a plume, sweeping
round together in grand curves to the left, where the group of
figures, hurried about the ferry boat, rises like a dash of spray;
they also radiating: so as to form one perfectly connected cluster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
with the two gens-d&rsquo;armes and the millstones; the millstones at
the bottom being the root of it; the two soldiers laid right and
left to sustain the branch of figures beyond, balanced just as a
tree bough would be.</p>

<p>§ 9. One of the gens-d&rsquo;armes is flirting with a young lady in
a round cap and full sleeves, under pretence of wanting her to
show him what she has in her bandbox. The motive of which
flirtation is, so far as Turner is concerned in it, primarily the
bandbox: this and the millstones below, give him a series of concave
lines, which, concentrated by the recumbent soldiers, intensify
the hollow sweep of the fall, precisely as the ring on
the stone does the Loire eddies. These curves are carried out
on the right by the small plate of eggs, laid to be washed at the
spring; and, all these concave lines being a little too quiet and
recumbent, the staggering casks are set on the left, and the ill-balanced
milk-pail on the right, to give a general feeling of
things being rolled over and over. The things which are to give
this sense of rolling are dark, in order to hint at the way in which
the cataract rolls boulders of rock; while the forms which are to
give the sense of its sweeping force are white. The little spring,
splashing out of its pine-trough, is to give contrast with the
power of the fall,&mdash;while it carries out the general sense of splashing
water.</p>

<p>§ 10. This spring exists on the spot, and so does everything
else in the picture; but the combinations are wholly arbitrary;
it being Turner&rsquo;s fixed principle to collect out of any scene
whatever was characteristic, and put it together just as he liked.
The changes made in this instance are highly curious. The mills
have no resemblance whatever to the real group as seen from this
spot; for there is a vulgar and formal dwelling-house in front of
them. But if you climb the rock behind them, you find they
form on that side a towering cluster, which Turner has put with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
little modification into the drawing. What he has done to the
mills, he has done with still greater audacity to the central rock.
Seen from this spot, it shows, in reality, its greatest breadth, and
is heavy and uninteresting; but on the Lauffen side, exposes its
consumed base, worn away by the rush of water, which Turner
resolving to show, serenely draws the rock as it appears from the
other side of the Rhine, and brings that view of it over to this
side. I have etched the bit with the rock a little larger below;
and if the reader knows the spot, he will see that this piece of
the drawing, reversed in the etching, is almost a bonâ fide unreversed
study of the fall from the Lauffen side.<a name="fa3q" id="fa3q" href="#ft3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>Finally, the castle of Lauffen itself, being, when seen from
this spot, too much foreshortened to show its extent, Turner
walks a quarter of a mile lower down the river, draws the castle
accurately there, brings it back with him, and puts it in all its
extent, where he chooses to have it, beyond the rocks.</p>

<p>I tried to copy and engrave this piece of the drawing of its
real size, merely to show the forms of the trees, drifted back by
the breeze from the fall, and wet with its spray; but in the endeavor
to facsimile the touches, great part of their grace and ease
has been lost; still, Plate 75 may, if compared with the same
piece in the Keepsake engraving, at least show that the original
drawing has not yet been rendered with completeness.</p>

<p>§ 11. These two examples may sufficiently serve to show the
mode in which minor details, both in form and spirit, are used
by Turner to aid his main motives; of course I cannot, in the
space of this volume, go on examining subjects at this length,
even if I had time to etch them; but every design of Turner&rsquo;s
would be equally instructive, examined in a similar manner.
Thus far, however, we have only seen the help of the parts to the
whole: we must give yet a little attention to the mode of combining
the smallest details.</p>

<p>I am always led away, in spite of myself, from my proper
subject here, invention formal, or the merely pleasant placing of
lines and masses, into the emotional results of such arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span></p>

<p>The chief reason of this is that the emotional power can be explained;
but the perfection of formative arrangement, as I said,
cannot be explained, any more than that of melody in music.
An instance or two of it, however, may be given.</p>

<p>§ 12. Much fine formative arrangement depends on a more
or less elliptical or pear-shaped balance of the group, obtained
by arranging the principal members of it on two opposite curves,
and either centralizing it by some powerful feature at the base,
centre, or summit; or else clasping it together by some conspicuous
point or knot. A very small object will often do this satisfactorily.</p>

<p>If you can get the complete series of Lefèbre&rsquo;s engravings
from Titian and Veronese, they will be quite enough to teach you,
in their dumb way, everything that is teachable of composition;
at all events, try to get the Madonna, with St. Peter and St.
George under the two great pillars; the Madonna and Child,
with mitred bishop on her left, and St. Andrew on her right;
and Veronese&rsquo;s Triumph of Venice. The first of these Plates
unites two formative symmetries; that of the two pillars, clasped
by the square altar-cloth below and cloud above, catches the eye
first; but the main group is the fivefold one rising to the left,
crowned by the Madonna. St. Francis and St. Peter form its
two wings, and the kneeling portrait figures, its base. It is
clasped at the bottom by the key of St. Peter, which points
straight at the Madonna&rsquo;s head, and is laid on the steps solely
for this purpose; the curved lines, which enclose the group,
meet also in her face; and the straight line of light, on the cloak
of the nearest senator, points at her also. If you have Turner&rsquo;s
Liber Studiorum, turn to the Lauffenburg, and compare the
figure group there: a fivefold chain, one standing figure, central;
two recumbent, for wings; two half-recumbent, for bases; and a
cluster of weeds to clasp. Then turn to Lefèbre&rsquo;s Europa (there
are two in the series&mdash;I mean the one with the two tree trunks
over her head). It is a wonderful ninefold group. Europa central;
two stooping figures, each surmounted by a standing one,
for wings; a cupid on one side, and dog on the other, for bases;
a cupid and trunk of tree, on each side, to terminate above; and
a garland for clasp.</p>

<p>§ 13. Fig. 94, page 171, will serve to show the mode in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
similar arrangements are carried into the smallest detail. It is
magnified four times from a cluster of leaves in the foreground
of the &ldquo;Isis&rdquo; (Liber Studiorum). Figs. 95 and 96, page 172,
show the arrangement of the two groups composing it; the lower
is purely symmetrical, with trefoiled centre and broad masses for
wings; the uppermost is a sweeping continuous curve, symmetrical,
but foreshortened. Both are clasped by arrow-shaped
leaves. The two whole groups themselves are, in turn, members
of another larger group, composing the entire foreground, and
consisting of broad dock-leaves, with minor clusters on the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
and left, of which these form the chief portion on the right
side.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 96.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>§ 14. Unless every leaf, and every visible point or object, however
small, forms a part of some harmony of this kind (these
symmetrical conditions being only the most simple and obvious),
it has no business in the picture. It is the necessary connection
of all the forms and colors, down to the last touch, which constitutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
great or inventive work, separated from all common work
by an impassable gulf.</p>

<p>By diligently copying the etchings of the Liber Studiorum,
the reader may, however, easily attain the perception of the existence
of these relations, and be prepared to understand Turner&rsquo;s
more elaborate composition. It would take many figures to disentangle
and explain the arrangements merely of the leaf cluster,
Fig. 78, facing page 97; but that there <i>is</i> a system, and that
every leaf has a fixed value and place in it, can hardly but be felt
at a glance.</p>

<p>It is curious that, in spite of all the constant talkings of
&ldquo;composition&rdquo; which goes on among art students, true composition
is just the last thing which appears to be perceived. One
would have thought that in this group, at least, the value of the
central black leaf would have been seen, of which the principal
function is to point towards, and continue, the line of bank
above. See Plate 62. But a glance at the published Plate in
the England series will show that no idea of the composition
had occurred to the engraver&rsquo;s mind. He thought any leaves
would do, and supplied them from his own repertory of hack
vegetation.</p>

<p>§ 15. I would willingly enlarge farther on this subject&mdash;it is
a favorite one with me; but the figures required for any exhaustive
treatment of it would form a separate volume. All that
I can do is to indicate, as these examples do sufficiently, the vast
field open to the student&rsquo;s analysis if he cares to pursue the subject;
and to mark for the general reader these two strong conclusions:&mdash;that
nothing in great work is ever either fortuitous or
contentious.</p>

<p>It is not fortuitous; that is to say, not left to fortune. The
&ldquo;must do it by a kind of felicity&rdquo; of Bacon is true; it is true
also that an accident is often suggestive to an inventor. Turner
himself said, &ldquo;I never lose an accident.&rdquo; But it is this not
<i>losing</i> it, this taking things out of the hands of Fortune, and
putting them into those of force and foresight, which attest the
master. Chance may sometimes help, and sometimes provoke, a
success; but must never rule, and rarely allure.</p>

<p>And, lastly, nothing must be contentious. Art has many uses
and many pleasantnesses; but of all its services, none are higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
than its setting forth, by a visible and enduring image, the nature
of all true authority and freedom; Authority which defines and
directs the action of benevolent law; and Freedom which consists
in deep and soft consent of individual<a name="fa4q" id="fa4q" href="#ft4q"><span class="sp">4</span></a> helpfulness.</p>

sketches on the steel, and I cannot sketch easily except straight from the
drawing, and without reversing. The looking-glass plagues me with cross
lights. As examples of composition, it does not the least matter which way
they are turned; and the reader may see this Schaffhausen subject from the
right side of the Rhine, by holding the book before a glass. The rude indications
of the figures in the Loire subject are nearly facsimiles of Turner&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE RULE OF THE GREATEST.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. In</span> the entire range of art principles, none perhaps present
a difficulty so great to the student, or require from the
teacher expression so cautious, and yet so strong, as those which
concern the nature and influence of magnitude.</p>

<p>In one sense, and that deep, there is no such thing as magnitude.
The least thing is as the greatest, and one day as a thousand
years, in the eyes of the Maker of great and small things.
In another sense, and that close to us and necessary, there exist
both magnitude and value. Though not a sparrow falls to the
ground unnoted, there are yet creatures who are of more value
than many; and the same Spirit which weighs the dust of the
earth in a balance, counts the isles as a little thing.</p>

<p>§ 2. The just temper of human mind in this matter may,
nevertheless, be told shortly. Greatness can only be rightly estimated
when minuteness is justly reverenced. Greatness is the
aggregation of minuteness; nor can its sublimity be felt truthfully
by any mind unaccustomed to the affectionate watching of
what is least.</p>

<p>But if this affection for the least be unaccompanied by the
powers of comparison and reflection; if it be intemperate in its
thirst, restless in curiosity, and incapable of the patient and self-commandant
pause which is wise to arrange, and submissive to
refuse, it will close the paths of noble art to the student as
effectually, and hopelessly, as even the blindness of pride, or
impatience of ambition.</p>

<p>§ 3. I say the paths of noble art, not of useful art. All
accurate investigation will have its reward; the morbid curiosity
will at least slake the thirst of others, if not its own; and the
diffused and petty affections will distribute, in serviceable measure,
their minute delights and narrow discoveries. The opposite error,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
the desire of greatness as such, or rather of what appears great to
indolence and vanity;&mdash;the instinct which I have described in
the &ldquo;Seven Lamps,&rdquo; noting it, among the Renaissance builders,
to be an especial and unfailing sign of baseness of mind, is as
fruitless as it is vile; no way profitable&mdash;every way harmful:
the widest and most corrupting expression of vulgarity. The
microscopic drawing of an insect may be precious; but nothing
except disgrace and misguidance will ever be gathered from such
work as that of Haydon or Barry.</p>

<p>§ 4. The work I have mostly had to do, since this essay was
begun, has been that of contention against such debased issues of
swollen insolence and windy conceit; but I have noticed lately,
that some lightly-budding philosophers have depreciated true
greatness; confusing the relations of scale, as they bear upon
human instinct and morality; reasoning as if a mountain were
no nobler than a grain of sand, or as if many souls were not of
mightier interest than one. To whom it must be shortly answered
that the Lord of power and life knew which were His
noblest works, when He bade His servant watch the play of the
Leviathan, rather than dissect the spawn of the minnow; and
that when it comes to practical question whether a single soul is
to be jeoparded for many, and this Leonidas, or Curtius, or
Winkelried shall abolish&mdash;so far as abolishable&mdash;his own spirit,
that he may save more numerous spirits, such question is to be
solved by the simple human instinct respecting number and
magnitude, not by reasonings on infinity:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>§ 5. In these passages, and those connected with them in the
chapter from which they are taken, itself so vast in scope, and
therefore so sublime, we may perhaps find the true relations of
minuteness, multitude, and magnitude. We shall not feel that
there is no such thing as littleness, or no such thing as magnitude.
Nor shall we be disposed to confuse a Volvox with the
Cordilleras; but we may learn that they both are bound together
by links of eternal life and toil; we shall see the vastest thing
noble, chiefly for what it includes; and the meanest for what it
accomplishes. Thence we might gather&mdash;and the conclusion
will be found in experience true&mdash;that the sense of largeness
would be most grateful to minds capable of comprehending, balancing,
and comparing; but capable also of great patience and
expectation; while the sense of minute wonderfulness would be
attractive to minds acted upon by sharp, small, penetrative sympathies,
and apt to be impatient, irregular, and partial. This
fact is curiously shown in the relations between the temper of
the great composers and the modern pathetic school. I was surprised
at the first rise of that school, now some years ago, by observing
how they restrained themselves to subjects which in
other hands would have been wholly uninteresting (compare Vol.
IV., p. 19); and in their succeeding efforts, I saw with increasing
wonder, that they were almost destitute of the power of feeling
vastness, or enjoying the forms which expressed it. A mountain
or great building only appeared to them as a piece of color of a
certain shape. The powers it represented, or included, were invisible
to them. In general they avoided subjects expressing
space or mass, and fastened on confined, broken, and sharp forms;
liking furze, fern, reeds, straw, stubble, dead leaves, and such
like, better than strong stones, broad-flowing leaves, or rounded
hills: in all such greater things, when forced to paint them, they
missed the main and mighty lines; and this no less in what they
loved than in what they disliked; for though fond of foliage,
their trees always had a tendency to congeal into little acicular
thorn-hedges, and never tossed free. Which modes of choice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
proceed naturally from a petulant sympathy with local and immediately
visible interests or sorrows, not regarding their large
consequences, nor capable of understanding more massive view
or more deeply deliberate mercifulness;&mdash;but peevish and horror-struck,
and often incapable of self-control, though not of self-sacrifice.
There are more people who can forget themselves than
govern themselves.</p>

<p>This narrowly pungent and bitter virtue has, however, its
beautiful uses, and is of special value in the present day, when
surface-work, shallow generalization, and cold arithmetical estimates
of things, are among the chief dangers and causes of misery
which men have to deal with.</p>

<p>§ 6. On the other hand, and in clear distinction from all such
workers, it is to be remembered that the great composers, not
less deep in feeling, are in the fixed habit of regarding as much
the relations and positions, as the separate nature, of things;
that they reap and thrash in the sheaf, never pluck ears to rub
in the hand; fish with net, not line, and sweep their prey together
within great cords of errorless curve;&mdash;that nothing ever bears
to them a separate or isolated aspect, but leads or links a chain of
aspects&mdash;that to them it is not merely the surface, nor the substance,
of anything that is of import; but its circumference and
continence: that they are pre-eminently patient and reserved;
observant, not curious;&mdash;comprehensive, not conjectural; calm
exceedingly; unerring, constant, terrible in steadfastness of intent;
unconquerable: incomprehensible: always suggesting,
implying, including, more than can be told.</p>

<p>§ 7. And this may be seen down to their treatment of the
smallest things.</p>

<p>For there is nothing so small but we may, as we choose, see it
in the whole, or in part, and in subdued connection with other
things, or in individual and petty prominence. The greatest
treatment is always that which gives conception the widest range,
and most harmonious guidance;&mdash;it being permitted us to employ
a certain quantity of time, and certain number of touches of pencil&mdash;he
who with these embraces the largest sphere of thought,
and suggests within that sphere the most perfect order of thought,
has wrought the most wisely, and therefore most nobly.</p>

<p>§ 8. I do not, however, purpose here to examine or illustrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
the nature of great treatment&mdash;to do so effectually would need
many examples from the figure composers; and it will be better
(if I have time to work out the subject carefully) that I should
do so in a form which may be easily accessible to young students.
Here I will only state in conclusion what it is chiefly important
for all students to be convinced of, that all the technical qualities
by which greatness of treatment is known, such as reserve in
color, tranquillity and largeness of line, and refusal of unnecessary
objects of interest, are, when they are real, the exponents of an
habitually noble temper of mind, never the observances of a precept
supposed to be useful. The refusal or reserve of a mighty
painter cannot be imitated; it is only by reaching the same intellectual
strength that you will be able to give an equal dignity
to your self-denial. No one can tell you beforehand what to accept,
or what to ignore; only remember always, in painting as
in eloquence, the greater your strength, the quieter will be your
manner, and the fewer your words; and in painting, as in all the
arts and acts of life, the secret of high success will be found, not
in a fretful, and various excellence, but in a quiet singleness of
justly chosen aim.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE LAW OF PERFECTNESS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§1. Among</span> the several characteristics of great treatment
which in the last chapter were alluded to without being enlarged
upon, one will be found several times named;&mdash;reserve.</p>

<p>It is necessary for our present purpose that we should understand
this quality more distinctly. I mean by it the power which
a great painter exercises over himself in fixing certain limits,
either of force, of color, or of quantity of work;&mdash;limits which he
will not transgress in any part of his picture, even though here
and there a painful sense of incompletion may exist, under the
fixed conditions, and might tempt an inferior workman to infringe
them. The nature of this reserve we must understand in
order that we may also determine the nature of true completion
or perfectness, which is the end of composition.</p>

<p>§ 2. For perfectness, properly so called, means harmony.
The word signifies, literally, the doing our work <i>thoroughly</i>. It
does not mean carrying it up to any constant and established
degree of finish, but carrying the whole of it up to a degree determined
upon. In a chalk or pencil sketch by a great master, it
will often be found that the deepest shades are feeble tints of pale
gray; the outlines nearly invisible, and the forms brought out by
a ghostly delicacy of touch, which, on looking close to the paper,
will be indistinguishable from its general texture. A single line
of ink, occurring anywhere in such a drawing, would of course
destroy it; placed in the darkness of a mouth or nostril, it would
turn the expression into a caricature; on a cheek or brow it
would be simply a blot. Yet let the blot remain, and let the
master work up to it with lines of similar force; and the drawing
which was before perfect, in terms of pencil, will become, under
his hand, perfect in terms of ink; and what was before a scratch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
on the cheek will become a necessary and beautiful part of its
gradation.</p>

<p>All great work is thus reduced under certain conditions, and
its right to be called complete depends on its fulfilment of them,
not on the nature of the conditions chosen. Habitually, indeed,
we call a colored work which is satisfactory to us, finished, and a
chalk drawing unfinished; but in the mind of the master, all his
work is, according to the sense in which you use the word, equally
perfect or imperfect. Perfect, if you regard its purpose and
limitation; imperfect, if you compare it with the natural standard.
In what appears to you consummate, the master has assigned to
himself terms of shortcoming, and marked with a sad severity
the point up to which he will permit himself to contend with
nature. Were it not for his acceptance of such restraint, he
could neither quit his work, nor endure it. He could not quit
it, for he would always perceive more that might be done; he
could not endure it, because all doing ended only in more elaborate
deficiency.</p>

<p>§ 3. But we are apt to forget, in modern days, that the
reserve of a man who is not putting forth half his strength is different
in manner and dignity from the effort of one who can do
no more. Charmed, and justly charmed, by the harmonious
sketches of great painters, and by the grandeur of their acquiescence
in the point of pause, we have put ourselves to produce
sketches as an end instead of a means, and thought to imitate the
painter&rsquo;s scornful restraint of his own power, by a scornful rejection
of the things beyond ours. For many reasons, therefore, it
becomes desirable to understand precisely and finally what a good
painter means by completion.</p>

<p>§ 4. The sketches of true painters may be classed under the
following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Experimental.</i>&mdash;In which they are assisting an imperfect
conception of a subject by trying the look of it on paper in different
ways.</p>

<p>By the greatest men this kind of sketch is hardly ever made;
they conceive their subjects distinctly at once, and their sketch is
not to try them, but to fasten them down. Raphael&rsquo;s form the
only important exception&mdash;and the numerous examples of experimental
work by him are evidence of his composition being technical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
rather than imaginative. I have never seen a drawing of
the kind by any great Venetian. Among the nineteen thousand
sketches by Turner&mdash;which I arranged in the National Gallery&mdash;there
was, to the best of my recollection, <i>not one</i>. In several instances
the work, after being carried forward a certain length, had
been abandoned and begun again with another view; sometimes
also two or more modes of treatment had been set side by side
with a view to choice. But there were always two distinct imaginations
contending for realization&mdash;not experimental modifications
of one.</p>

<p>§ 5. II. <i>Determinant.</i>&mdash;The fastening down of an idea in the
simplest terms, in order that it may not be disturbed or confused
by after work. Nearly all the great composers do this, methodically,
before beginning a painting. Such sketches are usually in
a high degree resolute and compressive; the best of them outlined
or marked calmly with the pen, and deliberately washed
with color, indicating the places of the principal lights.</p>

<p>Fine drawings of this class never show any hurry or confusion.
They are the expression of concluded operations of mind,
are drawn slowly, and are not so much sketches, as maps.</p>

<p>§ 6. III. <i>Commemorative.</i>&mdash;Containing records of facts which
the master required. These in their most elaborate form are
&ldquo;studies,&rdquo; or drawings, from Nature, of parts needed in the
composition, often highly finished in the part which is to be introduced.
In this form, however, they never occur by the
greatest imaginative masters. For by a truly great inventor
everything is invented; no atom of the work is unmodified by
his mind; and no study from nature, however beautiful, could
be introduced by him into his design without change; it would
not fit with the rest. Finished studies for introduction are
therefore chiefly by Leonardo and Raphael, both technical designers
rather than imaginative ones.</p>

<p>Commemorative sketches, by great masters, are generally
hasty, merely to put them in mind of motives of invention, or
they are shorthand memoranda of things with which they do
not care to trouble their memory; or, finally, accurate notes of
things which they must <i>not</i> modify by invention, as local detail,
costume, and such like. You may find perfectly accurate drawings
of coats of arms, portions of dresses, pieces of architecture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
and so on, by all the great men; but you will not find elaborate
studies of bits of their pictures.</p>

<p>§ 7. When the sketch is made merely as a memorandum, it is
impossible to say how little, or what kind of drawing, may be
sufficient for the purpose. It is of course likely to be hasty from
its very nature, and unless the exact purpose be understood, it
may be as unintelligible as a piece of shorthand writing. For instance,
in the corner of a sheet of sketches made at sea, among
those of Turner, at the National Gallery, occurs this one, Fig. 97.
I suppose most persons would not see much use in it. It nevertheless
was probably one of the most important sketches made
in Turner&rsquo;s life, fixing for ever in his mind certain facts respecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
the sunrise from a clear sea-horizon. Having myself watched
such sunrise, occasionally, I perceive this sketch to mean as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(Half circle at the top.) When the sun was only half out of
the sea, the horizon was sharply traced across its disk, and red
streaks of vapor crossed the lower part of it.</p>

<p>(Horseshoe underneath.) When the sun had risen so far as
to show three-quarters of its diameter, its light became so great
as to conceal the sea-horizon, consuming it away in descending
rays.</p>

<p>(Smaller horseshoe below.) When on the point of detaching
itself from the horizon, the sun still consumed away the line of
the sea, and looked as if pulled down by it.</p>

<p>(Broken oval.) Having risen about a fourth of its diameter
above the horizon, the sea-line reappeared; but the risen orb
was flattened by refraction into an oval.</p>

<p>(Broken circle.) Having risen a little farther above the sea-line,
the sun, at last, got itself round, and all right, with sparkling
reflection on the waves just below the sea-line.</p>

<p>This memorandum is for its purpose entirely perfect and efficient,
though the sun is not drawn carefully round, but with a
dash of the pencil; but there is no affected or desired slightness.
Could it have been drawn round as instantaneously, it would have
been. The purpose is throughout determined; there is no
scrawling, as in vulgar sketching.<a name="fa1r" id="fa1r" href="#ft1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>§ 8. Again, Fig. 98 is a facsimile of one of Turner&rsquo;s &ldquo;memoranda,&rdquo;
of a complete subject,<a name="fa2r" id="fa2r" href="#ft2r"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Lausanne, from the road to
Fribourg.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="tcr f90"><i>To face page 184.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 98.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>This example is entirely characteristic of his usual drawings
from nature, which unite two characters, being <i>both</i> commemorative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
and determinant:&mdash;Commemorative, in so far as they note
certain facts about the place: determinant, in that they record
an impression received from the place there and then, together
with the principal arrangement of the composition in which it
was afterwards to be recorded. In this mode of sketching, Turner
differs from all other men whose work I have studied. He
never draws accurately on the spot, with the intention of modifying
or composing afterwards from the materials; but instantly
modifies as he draws, placing his memoranda where they are to
be ultimately used, and taking exactly what he wants, not a fragment
or line more.</p>

<p>§ 9. This sketch has been made in the afternoon. He had
been impressed as he walked up the hill, by the vanishing of the
lake in the golden horizon, without end of waters, and by the opposition
of the pinnacled castle and cathedral to its level breadth.
That must be drawn! and from this spot, where all the buildings
are set well together. But it lucklessly happens that, though the
buildings come just where he wants them in situation, they don&rsquo;t
in height. For the castle (the square mass on the right) is in
reality higher than the cathedral, and would block out the end
of the lake. Down it goes instantly a hundred feet, that we may
see the lake over it; without the smallest regard for the military
position of Lausanne.</p>

<p>§ 10. Next: The last low spire on the left is in truth concealed
behind the nearer bank, the town running far down the
hill (and climbing another hill) in that direction. But the group
oi spires, without it, would not be rich enough to give a proper
impression of Lausanne, as a spiry place. Turner quietly sends
to fetch the church from round the corner, places it where he
likes, and indicates its distance only by aërial perspective (much
greater in the pencil drawing than in the woodcut).</p>

<p>§ 11. But again: Not only the spire of the lower church, but
the peak of the Rochers d&rsquo;Enfer (that highest in the distance)
would in reality be out of sight; it is much farther round to the
left. This would never do either; for without it, we should
have no idea that Lausanne was opposite the mountains, nor
should we have a nice sloping line to lead us into the distance.</p>

<p>With the same unblushing tranquillity of mind in which he
had ordered up the church, Turner sends also to fetch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
Rochers d&rsquo;Enfer; and puts <i>them</i> also where he chooses, to crown
the slope of distant hill, which, as every traveller knows, in its
decline to the west, is one of the most notable features of the
view from Lausanne.</p>

<p>§ 12. These modifications, easily traceable in the large features
of the design, are carried out with equal audacity and
precision in every part of it. Every one of those confused lines
on the right indicates something that is really there, only everything
is shifted and sorted into the exact places that Turner
chose. The group of dark objects near us at the foot of the
bank is a cluster of mills, which, when the picture was completed,
were to be the blackest things in it, and to throw back the castle,
and the golden horizon; while the rounded touches at the bottom,
under the castle, indicate a row of trees, which follow a
brook coming out of the ravine behind us; and were going to be
made very round indeed in the picture (to oppose the spiky and
angular masses of castle) and very consecutive, in order to form
another conducting line into the distance.</p>

<p>§ 13. These motives, or motives like them, might perhaps be
guessed on looking at the sketch. But no one without going to
the spot would understand the meaning of the vertical lines in
the left-hand lowest corner.</p>

<p>They are a &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo; of the artificial verticalness of a
low sandstone cliff, which has been cut down there to give space
for a bit of garden belonging to a public-house beneath, from
which garden a path leads along the ravine to the Lausanne rifle
ground. The value of these vertical lines in repeating those of
the cathedral is very great; it would be greater still in the completed
picture, increasing the sense of looking down from a
height, and giving grasp of, and power over, the whole scene.</p>

<p>§ 14. Throughout the sketch, as in all that Turner made, the
observing and combining intellect acts in the same manner. Not
a line is lost, nor a moment of time; and though the pencil flies,
and the whole thing is literally done as fast as a piece of shorthand
writing, it is to the full as purposeful and compressed, so
that while there are indeed dashes of the pencil which are unintentional,
they are only unintentional as the form of a letter is,
in fast writing, not from want of intention, but from the accident
of haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span></p>

<p>§ 15. I know not if the reader can understand,&mdash;I myself cannot,
though I see it to be demonstrable,&mdash;the simultaneous occurrence
of idea which produces such a drawing as this: the grasp
of the whole, from the laying of the first line, which induces continual
modifications of all that is done, out of respect to parts
not done yet. No line is ever changed or effaced: no experiment
made; but every touch is placed with reference to all that
are to succeed, as to all that have gone before; every addition
takes its part, as the stones in an arch of a bridge; the last
touch locks the arch. Remove that keystone, or remove any
other of the stones of the vault, and the whole will fall.</p>

<p>§ 16. I repeat&mdash;the power of mind which accomplishes this,
is yet wholly inexplicable to me, as it was when first I defined it
in the chapter on imagination associative, in the second volume.
But the grandeur of the power impresses me daily more and
more; and, in quitting the subject of invention, let me assert
finally, in clearest and strongest terms, that no painting is of
any true imaginative perfectness at all, unless it has been thus
conceived.</p>

<p>One sign of its being thus conceived may be always found in
the straightforwardness of its work. There are continual disputes
among artists as to the best way of doing things, which may
nearly all be resolved into confessions of indetermination. If
you know precisely what you want, you will not feel much hesitation
in setting about it; and a picture may be painted almost
any way, so only that it can be a straight way. Give a true
painter a ground of black, white, scarlet, or green, and out of it
he will bring what you choose. From the black, brightness; from
the white, sadness; from the scarlet, coolness; from the green,
glow: he will make anything out of anything, but in each case
his method will be pure, direct, perfect, the shortest and simplest
possible. You will find him, moreover, indifferent as to succession
of process. Ask him to begin at the bottom of the picture
instead of the top,&mdash;to finish two square inches of it without
touching the rest, or to lay a separate ground for every part before
finishing any;&mdash;it is all the same to him! What he will do if
left to himself, depends on mechanical convenience, and on the
time at his disposal. If he has a large brush in his hand, and
plenty of one color ground, he may lay as much as is wanted of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
that color, at once, in every part of the picture where it is to
occur; and if any is left, perhaps walk to another canvas, and lay
the rest of it where it will be wanted on that. If, on the contrary,
he has a small brush in his hand, and is interested in a
particular spot of the picture, he will, perhaps, not stir from it
till that bit is finished. But the absolutely best, or centrally, and
entirely <i>right</i> way of painting is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>§ 17. A light ground, white, red, yellow, or gray, not brown,
or black. On that an entirely accurate, and firm black outline of
the whole picture, in its principal masses. The outline to be
exquisitely correct as far as it reaches, but not to include small
details; the use of it being to limit the masses of first color.
The ground-colors then to be laid firmly, each on its own proper
part of the picture, as inlaid work in a mosaic table, meeting
each other truly at the edges: as much of each being laid as will
get itself into the state which the artist requires it to be in for
his second painting, by the time he comes to it. On this first
color, the second colors and subordinate masses laid in due order,
now, of course, necessarily without previous outline, and all small
detail reserved to the last, the bracelet being not touched, nor
indicated in the last, till the arm is finished.<a name="fa3r" id="fa3r" href="#ft3r"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>§ 18. This is, as far as it can be expressed in few words, the
right, or Venetian way of painting; but it is incapable of absolute
definition, for it depends on the scale, the material, and the
nature of the object represented, <i>how much</i> a great painter will
do with his first color; or how many after processes he will use.
Very often the first color, richly blended and worked into, is also
the last; sometimes it wants a glaze only to modify it; sometimes
an entirely different color above it. Turner&rsquo;s storm-blues,
for instance, were produced by a black ground, with opaque blue,
mixed with white, struck over it.<a name="fa4r" id="fa4r" href="#ft4r"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The amount of detail given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
in the first color will also depend on convenience. For instance,
if a jewel <i>fastens</i> a fold of dress, a Venetian will lay probably a
piece of the jewel color in its place at the time he draws the
fold; but if the jewel <i>falls upon</i> the dress, he will paint the
folds only in the ground color, and the jewel afterwards. For
in the first case his hand must pause, at any rate, where the fold
is fastened; so that he may as well mark the color of the gem:
but he would have to check his hand in the sweep with which he
drew the drapery, if he painted a jewel that fell upon it with the
first color. So far, however, as he can possibly use the under
color, he will, in whatever he has to superimpose. There is a
pretty little instance of such economical work in the painting of
the pearls on the breast of the elder princess, in our best Paul
Veronese (Family of Darius). The lowest is about the size of a
small hazel-nut, and falls on her rose-red dress. Any other but
a Venetian would have put a complete piece of white paint over
the dress, for the whole pearl, and painted into that the colors
of the stone. But Veronese knows beforehand that all the dark
side of the pearl will reflect the red of the dress. He will not
put white over the red, only to put red over the white again.
He leaves the actual dress for the dark side of the pearl, and with
two small separate touches, one white, another brown, places its
high light and shadow. This he does with perfect care and
calm; but in two decisive seconds. There is no dash, nor display,
nor hurry, nor error. The exactly right thing is done in
the exactly right place, and not one atom of color, nor moment
of time spent vainly. Look close at the two touches,&mdash;you wonder
what they mean. Retire six feet from the picture&mdash;the pearl
is there!</p>

<p>§ 19. The degree in which the ground colors are extended
over his picture, as he works, is to a great painter absolutely
indifferent. It is all the same to him whether he grounds a head,
and finishes it at once to the shoulders, leaving all round it
white; or whether he grounds the whole picture. His harmony,
paint as he will, never can be complete till the last touch is
given; so long as it remains incomplete, he does not care how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
little of it is suggested, or how many notes are missing. All is
wrong till all is right; and he must be able to bear the all-wrongness
till his work is done, or he cannot paint at all. His
mode of treatment will, therefore, depend on the nature of his
subject; as is beautifully shown in the water-color sketches by
Turner in the National Gallery. His general system was to complete
inch by inch; leaving the paper quite white all round,
especially if the work was to be delicate. The most exquisite
drawings left unfinished in the collection&mdash;those at Rome and
Naples&mdash;are thus outlined accurately on pure white paper, begun
in the middle of the sheet, and worked out to the side, finishing
as he proceeds. If, however, any united effect of light or color
is to embrace a large part of the subject, he will lay it in with a
broad wash over the whole paper at once; then paint into it using
it as a ground, and modifying it in the pure Venetian manner.
His oil pictures were laid roughly with ground colors, and
painted into with such rapid skill, that the artists who used to
see him finishing at the Academy sometimes suspected him of
having the picture finished underneath the colors he showed, and
removing, instead of adding, as they watched.</p>

<p>§ 20. But, whatever the means used may be, the certainty
and directness of them imply absolute grasp of the whole subject,
and without this grasp there is no good painting. This, finally,
let me declare, without qualification&mdash;that partial conception is
no conception. The whole picture must be imagined, or none of
it is. And this grasp of the whole implies very strange and sublime
qualities of mind. It is not possible, unless the feelings
are completely under control; the least excitement or passion
will disturb the measured equity of power; a painter needs to be
as cool as a general; and as little moved or subdued by his sense
of pleasure, as a soldier by the sense of pain. Nothing good can
be done without intense feeling; but it must be feeling so
crushed, that the work is set about with mechanical steadiness,
absolutely untroubled, as a surgeon,&mdash;not without pity, but conquering
it and putting it aside&mdash;begins an operation. Until the
feelings can give strength enough to the will to enable it to
conquer them, they are not strong enough. If you cannot leave
your picture at any moment;&mdash;cannot turn from it and go on
with another, while the color is drying;&mdash;cannot work at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
part of it you choose with equal contentment&mdash;you have not firm
enough grasp of it.</p>

<p>§ 21. It follows also, that no vain or selfish person can possibly
paint, in the noble sense of the word. Vanity and selfishness
are troublous, eager, anxious, petulant:&mdash;painting can only
be done in calm of mind. Resolution is not enough to secure
this; it must be secured by disposition as well. You may resolve
to think of your picture only; but, if you have been
fretted before beginning, no manly or clear grasp of it will be
possible for you. No forced calm is calm enough. Only honest
calm,&mdash;natural calm. You might as well try by external pressure
to smoothe a lake till it could reflect the sky, as by violence
of effort to secure the peace through which only you can reach
imagination. That peace must come in its own time; as the
waters settle themselves into clearness as well as quietness; you
can no more filter your mind into purity than you can compress
it into calmness; you must keep it pure, if you would have it
pure; and throw no stones into it, if you would have it quiet.
Great courage and self-command may, to a certain extent, give
power of painting without the true calmness underneath; but
never of doing first-rate work. There is sufficient evidence of
this, in even what we know of great men, though of the greatest,
we nearly always know the least (and that necessarily; they
being very silent, and not much given to setting themselves forth
to questioners; apt to be contemptuously reserved, no less than
unselfishly). But in such writings and sayings as we possess of
theirs, we may trace a quite curious gentleness and serene
courtesy. Rubens&rsquo; letters are almost ludicrous in their unhurried
politeness. Reynolds, swiftest of painters, was gentlest of
companions; so also Velasquez, Titian, and Veronese.</p>

<p>§ 22. It is gratuitous to add that no shallow or petty person
can paint. Mere cleverness or special gift never made an artist.
It is only perfectness of mind, unity, depth, decision, the highest
qualities, in fine, of the intellect, which will form the imagination.</p>

<p>§ 23. And, lastly, no false person can paint. A person false
at heart may, when it suits his purposes, seize a stray truth here
or there; but the relations of truth,&mdash;its perfectness,&mdash;that
which makes it wholesome truth, he can never perceive. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
wholeness and wholesomeness go together, so also sight with sincerity;
it is only the constant desire of, and submissiveness to
truth, which can measure its strange angles and mark its
infinite aspects; and fit them and knit them into the strength
of sacred invention.</p>

<p>Sacred, I call it deliberately; for it is thus, in the most accurate
senses, humble as well as helpful; meek in its receiving, as
magnificent in its disposing; the name it bears being rightly
given to invention formal, not because it forms, but because it
finds. For you cannot find a lie; you must make it for yourself.
False things may be imagined, and false things composed;
but only truth can be invented.</p>

and certainly many of Tintoret&rsquo;s, are painted on dark grounds; but this is
to save time, and with some loss to the future brightness of the color.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE DARK MIRROR.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. In</span> the course of our inquiry into the moral of landscape
(Vol. III., chap. 17), we promised, at the close of our work, to
seek for some better, or at least clearer, conclusions than were
then possible to us. We confined ourselves in that chapter to
the vindication of the probable utility of the <i>love</i> of natural
scenery. We made no assertion of the usefulness of <i>painting</i>
such scenery. It might be well to delight in the real country, or
admire the real flowers and true mountains. But it did not follow
that it was advisable to paint them.</p>

<p>Far from it. Many reasons might be given why we should
not paint them. All the purposes of good which we saw that
the beauty of nature could accomplish, may be better fulfilled
by the meanest of her realities than by the brightest of imitations.
For prolonged entertainment, no picture can be compared
with the wealth of interest which may be found in the
herbage of the poorest field, or blossoms of the narrowest copse.
As suggestive of supernatural power, the passing away of a fitful
rain-cloud, or opening of dawn, are in their change and mystery
more pregnant than any pictures. A child would, I suppose, receive
a religious lesson from a flower more willingly than from a
print of one, and might be taught to understand the nineteenth
Psalm, on a starry night, better than by diagrams of the constellations.</p>

<p>Whence it might seem a waste of time to draw landscape at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span></p>

<p>I believe it is;&mdash;to draw landscape mere and solitary, however
beautiful (unless it be for the sake of geographical or
other science, or of historical record). But there <i>is</i> a kind of
landscape which it is not inexpedient to draw. What kind,
we may probably discover by considering that which mankind
has hitherto contented itself with painting.</p>

<p>§ 2. We may arrange nearly all existing landscape under the
following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="sc">Heroic.</span>&mdash;Representing an imaginary world, inhabited by
men not perhaps perfectly civilized, but noble, and usually subjected
to severe trials, and by spiritual powers of the highest
order. It is frequently without architecture; never without
figure-action, or emotion. Its principal master is Titian.</p>

<p>II. <span class="sc">Classical.</span>&mdash;Representing an imaginary world, inhabited
by perfectly civilized men, and by spiritual powers of an inferior
order.</p>

<p>It generally assumes this condition of things to have existed
among the Greek and Roman nations. It contains usually architecture
of an elevated character, and always incidents of figure-action
and emotion. Its principal master is Nicolo Poussin.</p>

<p>III. <span class="sc">Pastoral.</span>&mdash;Representing peasant life and its daily
work, or such scenery as may naturally be suggestive of it, consisting
usually of simple landscape, in part subjected to agriculture,
with figures, cattle, and domestic buildings. No supernatural
being is ever visibly present. It does not in ordinary
cases admit architecture of an elevated character, nor exciting
incident. Its principal master is Cuyp.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="sc">Contemplative.</span>&mdash;Directed principally to the observance
of the powers of Nature, and record of the historical
associations connected with landscape, illustrated by, or contrasted
with, existing states of human life. No supernatural
being is visibly present. It admits every variety of subject, and
requires, in general, figure incident, but not of an exciting character.
It was not developed completely until recent times.
Its principal master is Turner.<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span></p>

<p>§ 3. These are the four true orders of landscape, not of
course distinctly separated from each other in all cases, but very
distinctly in typical examples. Two spurious forms require
separate note.</p>

<p>(<span class="scs">A.</span>) <span class="sc">Picturesque.</span>&mdash;This is indeed rather the degradation
(or sometimes the undeveloped state) of the Contemplative, than
a distinct class; but it may be considered generally as including
pictures meant to display the skill of the artist, and his powers
of composition; or to give agreeable forms and colors, irrespective
of sentiment. It will include much modern art, with the
street views and church interiors of the Dutch, and the works of
Canaletto, Guardi, Tempesta, and the like.</p>

<p>(<span class="scs">B.</span>) <span class="sc">Hybrid.</span>&mdash;Landscape in which the painter endeavors to
unite the irreconcileable sentiment of two or more of the above-named
classes. Its principal masters are Berghem and Wouvermans.</p>

<p>§ 4. Passing for the present by these inferior schools, we find
that all true landscape, whether simple or exalted, depends
primarily for its interest on connection with humanity, or with
spiritual powers. Banish your heroes and nymphs from the
classical landscape&mdash;its laurel shades will move you no more.
Show that the dark clefts of the most romantic mountain are
uninhabited and untraversed; it will cease to be romantic.
Fields without shepherds and without fairies will have no gaiety
in their green, nor will the noblest masses of ground or colors of
cloud arrest or raise your thoughts, if the earth has no life to
sustain, and the heaven none to refresh.</p>

<p>§ 5. It might perhaps be thought that, since from scenes in
which the figure was principal, and landscape symbolical and
subordinate (as in the art of Egypt), the process of ages had
led us to scenes in which landscape was principal and the figure
subordinate,&mdash;a continuance in the same current of feeling might
bring forth at last an art from which humanity and its interests
should wholly vanish, leaving us to the passionless admiration
of herbage and stone. But this will not, and cannot be. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
observe the parallel instance in the gradually increasing importance
of dress. From the simplicity of Greek design, concentrating,
I suppose, its skill chiefly on the naked form, the course
of time developed conditions of Venetian imagination which
found nearly as much interest, and expressed nearly as much
dignity, in folds of dress and fancies of decoration as in the
faces of the figures themselves; so that if from Veronese&rsquo;s
Marriage in Cana we remove the architecture and the gay
dresses, we shall not in the faces and hands remaining, find a
satisfactory abstract of the picture. But try it the other way.
Take out the faces; leave the draperies, and how then? Put
the fine dresses and jewelled girdles into the best group you can;
paint them with all Veronese&rsquo;s skill: will they satisfy you?</p>

<p>§ 6. Not so. As long as they are in their due service and
subjection&mdash;while their folds are formed by the motion of men,
and their lustre adorns the nobleness of men&mdash;so long the lustre
and the folds are lovely. But cast them from the human limbs;&mdash;golden
circlet and silken tissue are withered; the dead leaves
of autumn are more precious than they.</p>

<p>This is just as true, but in a far deeper sense, of the weaving
of the natural robe of man&rsquo;s soul. Fragrant tissue of flowers,
golden circlets of clouds, are only fair when they meet the
fondness of human thoughts, and glorify human visions of
heaven.</p>

<p>§ 7. It is the leaning on this truth which, more than any
other, has been the distinctive character of all my own past
work. And in closing a series of Art-studies, prolonged during
so many years, it may be perhaps permitted me to point out this
specialty&mdash;the rather that it has been, of all their characters, the
one most denied. I constantly see that the same thing takes
place in the estimation formed by the modern public of the work
of almost any true person, living or dead. It is not needful to
state here the causes of such error: but the fact is indeed so,
that precisely the distinctive root and leading force of any true
man&rsquo;s work and way are the things denied concerning him.</p>

<p>And in these books of mine, their distinctive character, as
essays on art, is their bringing everything to a root in human
passion or human hope. Arising first not in any desire to explain
the principles of art, but in the endeavor to defend an individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
painter from injustice, they have been colored throughout,&mdash;nay,
continually altered in shape, and even warped and
broken, by digressions respecting social questions, which had for
me an interest tenfold greater than the work I had been forced
into undertaking. Every principle of painting which I have
stated is traced to some vital or spiritual fact; and in my works
on architecture the preference accorded finally to one school over
another, is founded on a comparison of their influences on the
life of the workman&mdash;a question by all other writers on the subject
of architecture wholly forgotten or despised.</p>

<p>§ 8. The essential connection of the power of landscape with
human emotion is not less certain, because in many impressive
pictures the link is slight or local. That the connection should
exist at a single point is all that we need. The comparison with
the dress of the body may be carried out into the extremest parallelism.
It may often happen that no part of the figure wearing the
dress is discernible, nevertheless, the perceivable fact that the
drapery is worn by a figure makes all the difference. In one of
the most sublime figures in the world this is actually so: one of
the fainting Marys in Tintoret&rsquo;s Crucifixion has cast her mantle
over her head, and her face is lost in its shade, and her whole
figure veiled in folds of gray. But what the difference is between
that gray woof, that gathers round her as she falls, and the same
folds cast in a heap upon the ground, that difference, and more,
exists between the power of Nature through which humanity is
seen, and her power in the desert. Desert&mdash;whether of leaf or
sand&mdash;true desertness is not in the want of leaves, but of life.
Where humanity is not, and was not, the best natural beauty is
more than vain. It is even terrible; not as the dress cast aside
from the body; but as an embroidered shroud hiding a skeleton.</p>

<p>§ 9. And on each side of a right feeling in this matter there
lie, as usual, two opposite errors.</p>

<p>The first, that of caring for man only; and for the rest of
the universe, little, or not at all, which, in a measure, was the
error of the Greeks and Florentines; the other, that of caring
for the universe only;&mdash;for man, not at all,&mdash;which, in a measure,
is the error of modern science, and of the Art connecting
itself with such science.</p>

<p>The degree of power which any man may ultimately possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
in landscape-painting will depend finally on his perception of
this influence. If he has to paint the desert, its awfulness&mdash;if
the garden, its gladsomeness&mdash;will arise simply and only from
his sensibility to the story of life. Without this he is nothing
but a scientific mechanist; this, though it cannot make him yet
a painter, raises him to the sphere in which he may become one.
Nay, the mere shadow and semblance of this have given dangerous
power to works in all other respects unnoticeable; and the
least degree of its true presence has given value to work in all
other respects vain.</p>

<p>The true presence, observe, of sympathy with the spirit of
man. Where this is not, sympathy with any higher spirit is impossible.</p>

<p>For the directest manifestation of Deity to man is in His own
image, that is, in man.</p>

<p>§ 10. &ldquo;In his own image. After his likeness.&rdquo; <i>Ad imaginem
et similitudinem Suam.</i> I do not know what people in
general understand by those words. I suppose they ought to be
understood. The truth they contain seems to lie at the foundation
of our knowledge both of God and man; yet do we not
usually pass the sentence by, in dull reverence, attaching no
definite sense to it at all? For all practical purpose, might it
not as well be out of the text?</p>

<p>I have no time, nor much desire, to examine the vague expressions
of belief with which the verse has been encumbered.
Let us try to find its only possible plain significance.</p>

<p>§ 11. It cannot be supposed that the bodily shape of man resembles,
or resembled, any bodily shape in Deity. The likeness
must therefore be, or have been, in the soul. Had it wholly
passed away, and the Divine soul been altered into a soul brutal
or diabolic, I suppose we should have been told of the change.
But we are told nothing of the kind. The verse still stands as if
for our use and trust. It was only death which was to be our
punishment. Not <i>change</i>. So far as we live, the image is still
there; defiled, if you will; broken, if you will; all but effaced,
if you will, by death and the shadow of it. But not changed.
We are not made now in any other image than God&rsquo;s. There
are, indeed, the two states of this image&mdash;the earthly and heavenly,
but both Adamite, both human, both the same likeness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
only one defiled, and one pure. So that the soul of man is still
a mirror, wherein may be seen, darkly, the image of the mind of
God.</p>

<p>These may seem daring words. I am sorry that they do;
but I am helpless to soften them. Discover any other meaning
of the text if you are able;&mdash;but be sure that it <i>is</i> a meaning&mdash;a
meaning in your head and heart;&mdash;not a subtle gloss, nor a
shifting of one verbal expression into another, both idealess. I
repeat, that, to me, the verse has, and can have, no other signification
than this&mdash;that the soul of man is a mirror of the mind of
God. A mirror dark, distorted, broken, use what blameful
words you please of its state; yet in the main, a true mirror, out
of which alone, and by which alone, we can know anything of
God at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; the reader, perhaps, answers indignantly. &ldquo;I
know the nature of God by revelation, not by looking into myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Revelation to what? To a nature incapable of receiving
truth? That cannot be; for only to a nature capable of truth,
desirous of it, distinguishing it, feeding upon it, revelation is
possible. To a being undesirous of it, and hating it, revelation
is impossible. There can be none to a brute, or fiend. In so
far, therefore, as you love truth, and live therein, in so far revelation
can exist for you;&mdash;and in so far, your mind is the image
of God&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>§ 12. But consider farther, not only <i>to</i> what, but <i>by</i> what, is
the revelation. By sight? or word? If by sight, then to eyes
which see justly. Otherwise, no sight would be revelation. So
far, then, as your sight is just, it is the image of God&rsquo;s sight.</p>

<p>If by words,&mdash;how do you know their meanings? Here is a
short piece of precious word revelation, for instance. &ldquo;God is
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Love! yes. But what is <i>that</i>? The revelation does not tell
you that, I think. Look into the mirror, and you will see. Out
of your own heart you may know what love is. In no other possible
way,&mdash;by no other help or sign. All the words and sounds
ever uttered, all the revelations of cloud, or flame, or crystal, are
utterly powerless. They cannot tell you, in the smallest point,
what love means. Only the broken mirror can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span></p>

<p>§ 13. Here is more revelation. &ldquo;God is just!&rdquo; Just! What
is that? The revelation cannot help you to discover. You say
it is dealing equitably or equally. But how do you discern the
equality? Not by inequality of mind; not by a mind incapable
of weighing, judging, or distributing. If the lengths seem unequal
in the broken mirror, for you they are unequal; but if
they seem equal, then the mirror is true. So far as you recognize
equality, and your conscience tells you what is just, so far
your mind is the image of God&rsquo;s: and so far as you do <i>not</i> discern
this nature of justice or equality, the words &ldquo;God is just&rdquo;
bring no revelation to you.</p>

<p>§ 14. &ldquo;But His thoughts are not as our thoughts.&rdquo; No: the
sea is not as the standing pool by the wayside. Yet when the
breeze crisps the pool, you may see the image of the breakers,
and a likeness of the foam. Nay, in some sort, the same foam.
If the sea is for ever invisible to you, something you may learn
of it from the pool. Nothing, assuredly, any otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this poor miserable Me! Is <i>this</i>, then, all the book I
have got to read about God in?&rdquo; Yes, truly so. No other book,
nor fragment of book, than that, will you ever find;&mdash;no velvet-bound
missal, nor frankincensed manuscript;&mdash;nothing hieroglyphic
nor cuneiform; papyrus and pyramid are alike silent on
this matter;&mdash;nothing in the clouds above, nor in the earth beneath.
That flesh-bound volume is the only revelation that is,
that was, or that can be. In that is the image of God painted;
in that is the law of God written; in that is the promise of God
revealed. Know thyself; for through thyself only thou canst
know God.</p>

<p>§ 15. Through the glass, darkly. But, except through the
glass, in nowise.</p>

<p>A tremulous crystal, waved as water, poured out upon the
ground;&mdash;you may defile it, despise it, pollute it at your pleasure,
and at your peril; for on the peace of those weak waves
must all the heaven you shall ever gain be first seen; and through
such purity as you can win for those dark waves, must all the
light of the risen Sun of righteousness be bent down, by faint
refraction. Cleanse them, and calm them, as you love your
life.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that all the power of nature depends on subjection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
to the human soul. Man is the sun of the world; more
than the real sun. The fire of his wonderful heart is the only
light and heat worth gauge or measure. Where he is, are the
tropics; where he is not, the ice-world.</p>

<p><a name="ft1s" id="ft1s" href="#fa1s"><span class="fn">1</span></a> I have been embarrassed in assigning the names to these orders of art,
the term &ldquo;Contemplative&rdquo; belonging in justice nearly as much to the
romantic and pastoral conception as to the modern landscape. I intended,
originally, to call the four schools&mdash;Romantic, Classic, Georgic, and Theoretic&mdash;which
would have been more accurate; and more consistent with the
nomenclature of the second volume; but would not have been pleasant in
sound, nor to the general reader, very clear in sense.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE LANCE OF PALLAS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. It</span> might be thought that the tenor of the preceding
chapter was in some sort adverse to my repeated statement that
all great art is the expression of man&rsquo;s delight in God&rsquo;s work,
not in <i>his own.</i> But observe, he is not himself his own work:
he is himself precisely the most wonderful piece of God&rsquo;s workmanship
extant. In this best piece not only he is bound to take
delight, but cannot, in a right state of thought, take delight in
anything else, otherwise than through himself. Through himself,
however, as the sun of creation, not as <i>the</i> creation. In
himself, as the light of the world.<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Not as being the world.
Let him stand in his due relation to other creatures, and to inanimate
things&mdash;know them all and love them, as made for him,
and he for them;&mdash;and he becomes himself the greatest and
holiest of them. But let him cast off this relation, despise and
forget the less creation around him, and instead of being the
light of the world, he is as a sun in space&mdash;a fiery ball, spotted
with storm.</p>

<p>§ 2. All the diseases of mind leading to fatalest ruin consist
primarily in this isolation. They are the concentration of man
upon himself, whether his heavenly interests or his worldly interests,
matters not; it is the being <i>his own</i> interests which makes
the regard of them so mortal. Every form of asceticism on one
side, of sensualism on the other, is an isolation of his soul or of
his body; the fixing his thoughts upon them alone: while every
healthy state of nations and of individual minds consists in the
unselfish presence of the human spirit everywhere, energizing
over all things; speaking and living through all things.</p>

<p>§ 3. Man being thus the crowning and ruling work of God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
it will follow that all his best art must have something to tell
about himself, as the soul of things, and ruler of creatures. It
must also make this reference to himself under a true conception
of his own nature. Therefore all art which involves no reference
to man is inferior or nugatory. And all art which involves misconception
of man, or base thought of him, is in that degree
false, and base.</p>

<p>Now the basest thought possible concerning him is, that he
has no spiritual nature; and the foolishest misunderstanding of
him possible is, that he has or should have, no animal nature.
For his nature is nobly animal, nobly spiritual&mdash;coherently and
irrevocably so; neither part of it may, but at its peril, expel,
despise, or defy the other. All great art confesses and worships
both.</p>

<p>§ 4. The art which, since the writings of Rio and Lord Lindsay,
is specially known as &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; erred by pride in its denial
of the animal nature of man;&mdash;and, in connection with all
monkish and fanatical forms of religion, by looking always to
another world instead of this. It wasted its strength in visions,
and was therefore swept away, notwithstanding all its good and
glory, by the strong truth of the naturalist art of the sixteenth
century. But that naturalist art erred on the other side; denied
at last the spiritual nature of man, and perished in corruption.</p>

<p>A contemplative reaction is taking place in modern times,
out of which it may be hoped a new spiritual art may be developed.
The first school of landscape, named, in the foregoing
chapter, the Heroic, is that of the noble naturalists. The second
(Classical), and third (Pastoral), belong to the time of sensual
decline. The fourth (Contemplative) is that of modern revival.</p>

<p>§ 5. But why, the reader will ask, is no place given in this
scheme to the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; or spiritual art which preceded the
naturalists? Because all landscape belonging to that art is subordinate,
and in one essential principle false. It is subordinate,
because intended only to exalt the conception of saintly or Divine
presence:&mdash;rather therefore to be considered as a landscape
decoration or type, than an effort to paint nature. If I included
it in my list of schools, I should have to go still farther back,
and include with it the conventional and illustrative landscape
of the Greeks and Egyptians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span></p>

<p>§ 6. But also it cannot constitute a real school, because its
first assumption is false, namely, that the natural world can be
represented without the element of death.</p>

<p>The real schools of landscape are primarily distinguished
from the preceding unreal ones by their introduction of this element.
They are not at first in any sort the worthier for it.
But they are more true, and capable, therefore, in the issue, of
becoming worthier.</p>

<p>It will be a hard piece of work for us to think this rightly
out, but it must be done.</p>

<p>§ 7. Perhaps an accurate analysis of the schools of art of all
time might show us that when the immortality of the soul was
practically and completely believed, the elements of decay, danger,
and grief in visible things were always disregarded. However
this may be, it is assuredly so in the early Christian schools.
The ideas of danger or decay seem not merely repugnant, but
inconceivable to them; the expression of immortality and perpetuity
is alone possible. I do not mean that they take no note
of the absolute fact of corruption. This fact the early painters
often compel themselves to look fuller in the front than any
other men: as in the way they usually paint the Deluge (the
raven feeding on the bodies), and in all the various triumphs and
processions of the Power of Death, which formed one great chapter
of religious teaching and painting, from Orcagna&rsquo;s time to
the close of the Purist epoch. But I mean that this external
fact of corruption is separated in their minds from the main conditions
of their work; and its horror enters no more into their
general treatment of landscape than the fear of murder or martyrdom,
both of which they had nevertheless continually to represent.
None of these things appeared to them as affecting the
general dealings of the Deity with His world. Death, pain, and
decay were simply momentary accidents in the course of immortality,
which never ought to exercise any depressing influence
over the hearts of men, or in the life of Nature. God, in intense
life, peace, and helping power, was always and everywhere.
Human bodies, at one time or another, had indeed to be made
dust of, and raised from it; and this becoming dust was hurtful
and humiliating, but not in the least melancholy, nor, in any
very high degree, important; except to thoughtless persons, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
needed sometimes to be reminded of it, and whom, not at all
fearing the things much himself, the painter accordingly did
remind of it, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>§ 8. A similar condition of mind seems to have been attained,
not unfrequently, in modern times, by persons whom either narrowness
of circumstance or education, or vigorous moral efforts
have guarded from the troubling of the world, so as to give them
firm and childlike trust in the power and presence of God, together
with peace of conscience, and a belief in the passing of all evil
into some form of good. It is impossible that a person thus disciplined
should feel, in any of its more acute phases, the sorrow
for any of the phenomena of nature, or terror in any material
danger which would occur to another. The absence of personal
fear, the consciousness of security as great in the midst of pestilence
and storm, as amidst beds of flowers on a summer morning,
and the certainty that whatever appeared evil, or was assuredly
painful, must eventually issue in a far greater and enduring good&mdash;this
general feeling and conviction, I say, would gradually lull,
and at last put to entire rest, the physical sensations of grief and
fear; so that the man would look upon danger without dread,&mdash;accept
pain without lamentation.</p>

<p>§ 9. It may perhaps be thought that this is a very high and
right state of mind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears that the attainment of it is never
possible without inducing some form of intellectual weakness.</p>

<p>No painter belonging to the purest religious schools ever
mastered his art. Perugino nearly did so; but it was because
he was more rational&mdash;more a man of the world&mdash;than the rest.
No literature exists of a high class produced by minds in the
pure religious temper. On the contrary, a great deal of literature
exists, produced by persons in that temper, which is markedly,
and very far, below average literary work.</p>

<p>§ 10. The reason of this I believe to be, that the right faith of
man is not intended to give him repose, but to enable him to do
his work. It is not intended that he should look away from the
place he lives in now, and cheer himself with thoughts of the
place he is to live in next, but that he should look stoutly into
this world, in faith that if he does his work thoroughly here,
some good to others or himself, with which, however, he is not at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
present concerned, will come of it hereafter. And this kind of
brave, but not very hopeful or cheerful faith, I perceive to be
always rewarded by clear practical success and splendid intellectual
power; while the faith which dwells on the future fades
away into rosy mist, and emptiness of musical air. That result
indeed follows naturally enough on its habit of assuming that
things must be right, or must come right, when, probably, the
fact is, that so far as we are concerned, they are entirely wrong;
and going wrong: and also on its weak and false way of looking
on what these religious persons call &ldquo;the bright side of things,&rdquo;
that is to say, on one side of them only, when God has given them
two sides, and intended us to see both.</p>

<p>§ 11. I was reading but the other day, in a book by a zealous,
useful, and able Scotch clergyman, one of these rhapsodies, in
which he described a scene in the Highlands to show (he said)
the goodness of God. In this Highland scene there was nothing
but sunshine, and fresh breezes, and bleating lambs, and clean
tartans, and all manner of pleasantness. Now a Highland scene
is, beyond dispute, pleasant enough in its own way; but, looked
close at, has its shadows. Here, for instance, is the very fact of
one, as pretty as I can remember&mdash;having seen many. It is a
little valley of soft turf, enclosed in its narrow oval by jutting
rocks and broad flakes of nodding fern. From one side of it to
the other winds, serpentine, a clear brown stream, drooping into
quicker ripple as it reaches the end of the oval field, and then,
first islanding a purple and white rock with an amber pool, it
dashes away into a narrow fall of foam under a thicket of mountain
ash and alder. The autumn sun, low but clear, shines on
the scarlet ash-berries and on the golden birch-leaves, which,
fallen here and there, when the breeze has not caught them, rest
quiet in the crannies of the purple rock. Beside the rock, in the
hollow under the thicket, the carcass of a ewe, drowned in the
last flood, lies nearly bare to the bone, its white ribs protruding
through the skin, raven-torn; and the rags of its wool still flickering
from the branches that first stayed it as the stream swept
it down. A little lower, the current plunges, roaring, into a
circular chasm like a well, surrounded on three sides by a chimney-like
hollowness of polished rock, down which the foam slips
in detached snow-flakes. Round the edges of the pool beneath,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
the water circles slowly, like black oil; a little butterfly lies on
its back, its wings glued to one of the eddies, its limbs feebly
quivering; a fish rises and it is gone. Lower down the stream,
I can just see, over a knoll, the green and damp turf roofs of four
or five hovels, built at the edge of a morass, which is trodden by
the cattle into a black Slough of Despond at their doors, and
traversed by a few ill-set stepping-stones, with here and there a
flat slab on the tops, where they have sunk out of sight; and at
the turn of the brook I see a man fishing, with a boy and a dog&mdash;a
picturesque and pretty group enough certainly, if they had not
been there all day starving. I know them, and I know the dog&rsquo;s
ribs also, which are nearly as bare as the dead ewe&rsquo;s; and the
child&rsquo;s wasted shoulders, cutting his old tartan jacket through,
so sharp are they. We will go down and talk with the man.</p>

<p>§ 12. Or, that I may not piece pure truth with fancy, for I
have none of his words set down, let us hear a word or two from
another such, a Scotchman also, and as true hearted, and in just
as fair a scene. I write out the passage, in which I have kept
his few sentences, word for word, as it stands in my private
diary:&mdash;&ldquo;22nd April (1851). Yesterday I had a long walk up
the Via Gellia, at Matlock, coming down upon it from the hills
above, all sown with anemones and violets, and murmuring with
sweet springs. Above all the mills in the valley, the brook, in
its first purity, forms a small shallow pool, with a sandy bottom
covered with cresses, and other water plants. A man was wading
in it for cresses as I passed up the valley, and bade me good-day.
I did not go much farther; he was there when I returned. I
passed him again, about one hundred yards, when it struck me I
might as well learn all I could about watercresses: so I turned
back. I asked the man, among other questions, what he called
the common weed, something like watercress, but with a serrated
leaf, which grows at the edge of nearly all such pools. &lsquo;We
calls that brooklime, hereabouts,&rsquo; said a voice behind me. I
turned, and saw three men, miners or manufacturers&mdash;two evidently
Derbyshire men, and respectable-looking in their way;
the third, thin, poor, old, and harder-featured, and utterly in
rags. &lsquo;Brooklime?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;What do you call it lime for?&rsquo;
The man said he did not know, it was called that. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find
that in the British &lsquo;Erba,&rsquo; said the weak, calm voice of the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
man. I turned to him in much surprise; but he went on saying
something drily (I hardly understood what) to the cress-gatherer;
who contradicting him, the old man said he &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t know fresh
water,&rsquo; he &lsquo;knew enough of sa&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;Have you been a sailor?&rsquo; I
asked.  &lsquo;I was a sailor for eleven years and ten months of my
life,&rsquo; he said, in the same strangely quiet manner. &lsquo;And what
are you now?&rsquo; &lsquo;I lived for ten years after my wife&rsquo;s death by
picking up rags and bones; I hadn&rsquo;t much occasion afore.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And now how do you live?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, I lives hard and honest,
and haven&rsquo;t got to live long,&rsquo; or something to that effect. He
then went on, in a kind of maundering way, about his wife. &lsquo;She
had rheumatism and fever very bad; and her second rib grow&rsquo;d
over her hench-bone. A&rsquo; was a clever woman, but a&rsquo; grow&rsquo;d to
be a very little one&rsquo; (this with an expression of deep melancholy).
&lsquo;Eighteen years after her first lad she was in the family-way
again, and they had doctors up from Lunnon about it. They
wanted to rip her open and take the child out of her side. But
I never would give my consent.&rsquo; (Then, after a pause:) &lsquo;She
died twenty-six hours and ten minutes after it. I never cared
much what come of me since; but I know that I shall soon reach
her; that&rsquo;s a knowledge I would na gie for the king&rsquo;s crown.&rsquo;
&lsquo;You are a Scotchman, are not you?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m from the
Isle of Skye, sir; I&rsquo;m a McGregor.&rsquo; I said something about his
religious faith. &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll know I was bred in the Church of Scotland,
sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I love it as I love my own soul; but I
think thae Wesleyan Methodists ha&rsquo; got salvation among them,
too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Truly, this Highland and English hill-scenery is fair enough;
but has its shadows; and deeper coloring, here and there, than
that of heath and rose.</p>

<p>§ 13. Now, as far as I have watched the main powers of human
mind, they have risen first from the resolution to see fearlessly,
pitifully, and to its very worst, what these deep colors
mean, wheresoever they fall; not by any means to pass on the
other side looking pleasantly up to the sky, but to stoop to the
horror, and let the sky, for the present, take care of its own
clouds. However this may be in moral matters, with which I
have nothing here to do, in my own field of inquiry the fact is
so; and all great and beautiful work has come of first gazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
without shrinking into the darkness. If, having done so, the
human spirit can, by its courage and faith, conquer the evil, it
rises into conceptions of victorious and consummated beauty. It
is then the spirit of the highest Greek and Venetian Art. If
unable to conquer the evil, but remaining in strong, though
melancholy war with it, not rising into supreme beauty, it is the
spirit of the best northern art, typically represented by that of
Holbein and Durer. If, itself conquered by the evil, infected by
the dragon breath of it, and at last brought into captivity, so as
to take delight in evil for ever, it becomes the spirit of the dark,
but still powerful sensualistic art, represented typically by that of
Salvator. We must trace this fact briefly through Greek, Venetian,
and Dureresque art; we shall then see how the art of decline
came of avoiding the evil, and seeking pleasure only; and
thus obtain, at last, some power of judging whether the tendency
of our own contemplative art be right or ignoble.</p>

<p>§ 14. The ruling purpose of Greek poetry is the assertion of
victory, by heroism, over fate, sin, and death. The terror of
these great enemies is dwelt upon chiefly by the tragedians.
The victory over them by Homer.</p>

<p>The adversary chiefly contemplated by the tragedians is Fate,
or predestinate misfortune. And that under three principal
forms.</p>

<p><span class="scs">A.</span> Blindness, or ignorance; not in itself guilty, but inducing
acts which otherwise would have been guilty; and leading, no
less than guilt, to destruction.<a name="fa2t" id="fa2t" href="#ft2t"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><span class="scs">B.</span> Visitation upon one person of the sin of another.</p>

<p><span class="scs">C.</span> Repression, by brutal or tyrannous strength, of a benevolent
will.</p>

<p>§ 15. In all these cases sorrow is much more definitely connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
with sin by the Greek tragedians than by Shakspere. The
&ldquo;fate&rdquo; of Shakspere is, indeed, a form of blindness, but it issues
in little more than haste or indiscretion. It is, in the literal
sense, &ldquo;fatal,&rdquo; but hardly criminal.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;I am fortune&rsquo;s fool&rdquo; of Romeo, expresses Shakspere&rsquo;s
primary idea of tragic circumstance. Often his victims are entirely
innocent, swept away by mere current of strong encompassing
calamity (Ophelia, Cordelia, Arthur, Queen Katharine).
This is rarely so with the Greeks. The victim may indeed be
innocent, as Antigone, but is in some way resolutely entangled
with crime, and destroyed by it, as if it struck by pollution, no
less than participation.</p>

<p>The victory over sin and death is therefore also with the
Greek tragedians more complete than with Shakspere. As the
enemy has more direct moral personality,&mdash;as it is sinfulness
more than mischance, it is met by a higher moral resolve, a
greater preparation of heart, a more solemn patience and purposed
self-sacrifice. At the close of a Shakspere tragedy nothing
remains but dead march and clothes of burial. At the close of a
Greek tragedy there are far-off sounds of a divine triumph, and
a glory as of resurrection.<a name="fa3t" id="fa3t" href="#ft3t"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>§ 16. The Homeric temper is wholly different. Far more
tender, more practical, more cheerful; bent chiefly on present
things and giving victory now, and here, rather than in hope, and
hereafter. The enemies of mankind, in Homer&rsquo;s conception, are
more distinctly conquerable; they are ungoverned passions,
especially anger, and unreasonable impulse generally (<span class="grk" title="atê">&#7936;&#964;&#8052;</span>).
Hence the anger of Achilles, misdirected by pride, but rightly
directed by friendship, is the subject of the <i>Iliad</i>. The anger
of Ulysses (<span class="grk" title="Odysseus">&#8008;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#8058;&#962;</span> &ldquo;the angry&rdquo;), misdirected at first into
idle and irregular hostilities, directed at last to execution of
sternest justice, is the subject of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p>Though this is the central idea of the two poems, it is connected
with general display of the evil of all unbridled passions,
pride, sensuality, indolence, or curiosity. The pride of Atrides,
the passion of Paris, the sluggishness of Elpenor, the curiosity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
Ulysses himself about the Cyclops, the impatience of his sailors
in untying the winds, and all other faults or follies, down to that&mdash;(evidently
no small one in Homer&rsquo;s mind)&mdash;of domestic disorderliness,
are throughout shown in contrast with conditions of
patient affection and household peace.</p>

<p>Also, the wild powers and mysteries of Nature are in the
Homeric mind among the enemies of man; so that all the labors
of Ulysses are an expression of the contest of manhood, not only
with its own passions or with the folly of others, but with the
merciless and mysterious powers of the natural world.</p>

<p>§ 17. This is perhaps the chief signification of the seven years&rsquo;
stay with Calypso, &ldquo;the concealer.&rdquo; Not, as vulgarly thought,
the concealer of Ulysses, but the great concealer&mdash;the hidden
power of natural things. She is the daughter of Atlas and the
Sea (Atlas, the sustainer of heaven, and the Sea, the disturber of
the Earth). She dwells in the island of Ogygia (&ldquo;the ancient
or venerable&rdquo;). (Whenever Athens, or any other Greek city, is
spoken of with any peculiar reverence, it is called &ldquo;Ogygian.&rdquo;)
Escaping from this goddess of secrets, and from other spirits,
some of destructive natural force (Scylla), others signifying the
enchantment of mere natural beauty (Circe, daughter of the Sun
and Sea), he arrives at last at the Phæacian land, whose king is
&ldquo;strength with intellect,&rdquo; and whose queen, &ldquo;virtue.&rdquo; These
restore him to his country.</p>

<p>§ 18. Now observe that in their dealing with all these subjects
the Greeks never shrink from horror; down to its uttermost
depth, to its most appalling physical detail, they strive to
sound the secrets of sorrow. For them there is no passing by
on the other side, no turning away the eyes to vanity from pain.
Literally, they have not &ldquo;lifted up their souls unto vanity.&rdquo;
Whether there be consolation for them or not, neither apathy nor
blindness shall be their saviours; if, for them, thus knowing the
facts of the grief of earth, any hope, relief, or triumph may hereafter
seem possible,&mdash;well; but if not, still hopeless, reliefless,
eternal, the sorrow shall be met face to face. This Hector, so
righteous, so merciful, so brave, has, nevertheless, to look upon
his dearest brother in miserablest death. His own soul passes
away in hopeless sobs through the throat-wound of the Grecian
spear. That is one aspect of things in this world, a fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
world truly, but having, among its other aspects, this one, highly
ambiguous.</p>

<p>§ 19. Meeting it boldly as they may, gazing right into the
skeleton face of it, the ambiguity remains; nay, in some sort
gains upon them. We trusted in the gods;&mdash;we thought that
wisdom and courage would save us. Our wisdom and courage
themselves deceive us to our death. Athena had the aspect of
Deiphobus&mdash;terror of the enemy. She has not terrified him, but
left us, in our mortal need.</p>

<p>And, beyond that mortality, what hope have we? Nothing
is clear to us on that horizon, nor comforting. Funeral honors;
perhaps also rest; perhaps a shadowy life&mdash;artless, joyless, loveless.
No devices in that darkness of the grave, nor daring, nor
delight. Neither marrying nor giving in marriage, nor casting
of spears, nor rolling of chariots, nor voice of fame. Lapped in
pale Elysian mist, chilling the forgetful heart and feeble frame,
shall we waste on forever? Can the dust of earth claim more of
immortality than this? Or shall we have even so much as rest?
May we, indeed, lie down again in the dust, or have our sins not
hidden from us even the things that belong to that peace? May
not chance and the whirl of passion govern us there; when
there shall be no thought, nor work, nor wisdom, nor breathing
of the soul?<a name="fa4t" id="fa4t" href="#ft4t"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>Be it so. With no better reward, no brighter hope, we will
be men while we may: men, just, and strong, and fearless, and
up to our power, perfect. Athena herself, our wisdom and our
strength, may betray us;&mdash;Ph&oelig;bus, our sun, smite us with plague,
or hide his face from us helpless;&mdash;Jove and all the powers of
fate oppress us, or give us up to destruction. While we live, we
will hold fast our integrity; no weak tears shall blind us, no untimely
tremors abate our strength of arm nor swiftness of limb.
The gods have given us at least this glorious body and this
righteous conscience; these will we keep bright and pure to the
end. So may we fall to misery, but not to baseness; so may we
sink to sleep, but not to shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span></p>

<p>§ 20. And herein was conquest. So defied, the betraying and
accusing shadows shrank back; the mysterious horror subdued
itself to majestic sorrow. Death was swallowed up in victory.
Their blood, which seemed to be poured out upon the ground,
rose into hyacinthine flowers. All the beauty of earth opened to
them; they had ploughed into its darkness, and they reaped its
gold; the gods, in whom they had trusted through all semblance
of oppression, came down to love them and be their helpmates.
All nature round them became divine,&mdash;one harmony of power
and peace. The sun hurt them not by day, nor the moon by
night; the earth opened no more her jaws into the pit; the sea
whitened no more against them the teeth of his devouring waves.
Sun, and moon, and earth, and sea,&mdash;all melted into grace and
love; the fatal arrows rang not now at the shoulders of Apollo
the healer; lord of life and of the three great spirits of life&mdash;Care,
Memory, and Melody. Great Artemis guarded their flocks
by night; Selene kissed in love the eyes of those who slept. And
from all came the help of heaven to body and soul; a strange
spirit lifting the lovely limbs; strange light glowing on the
golden hair; and strangest comfort filling the trustful heart, so
that they could put off their armor, and lie down to sleep,&mdash;their

clearly, there being two vessels&mdash;one full of sorrow, the other of

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE WINGS OF THE LION.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Such</span> being the heroic spirit of Greek religion and art, we
may now with ease trace the relations between it and that which
animated the Italian, and chiefly the Venetian, schools.</p>

<p>Observe, all the nobleness, as well as the faults, of the Greek
art were dependent on its making the most of this present life.
It might do so in the Anacreontic temper&mdash;<span class="grk" title="Ti Pleiadessi,
kamoi">&#932;&#943; &#928;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#953;, &#954;&#8064;&#956;&#959;&#943;</span>; &ldquo;What have I to do with the Pleiads?&rdquo; or in the defiant
or the trustful endurance of fate;&mdash;but its dominion was in this
world.</p>

<p>Florentine art was essentially Christian, ascetic, expectant of
a better world, and antagonistic, therefore, to the Greek temper.
So that the Greek element, once forced upon it, destroyed it.
There was absolute incompatibility between them. Florentine
art, also, could not produce landscape. It despised the rock,
the tree, the vital air itself, aspiring to breathe empyreal air.</p>

<p>Venetian art began with the same aim and under the same
restrictions. Both are healthy in the youth of art. Heavenly
aim and severe law for boyhood; earthly work and fair freedom
for manhood.</p>

<p>§ 2. The Venetians began, I repeat, with asceticism; always,
however, delighting in more massive and deep color than other
religious painters. They are especially fond of saints who have
been cardinals, because of their red hats, and they sunburn all
their hermits into splendid russet brown.</p>

<p>They differed from the Pisans in having no Maremma between
them and the sea; from the Romans, in continually quarrelling
with the Pope; and from the Florentines in having no
gardens.</p>

<p>They had another kind of garden, deep-furrowed, with blossom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
in white wreaths&mdash;fruitless. Perpetual May therein, and
singing of wild, nestless birds. And they had no Maremma to
separate them from this garden of theirs. The destiny of Pisa
was changed, in all probability, by the ten miles of marsh-land
and poisonous air between it and the beach. The Genoese energy
was feverish; too much heat reflected from their torrid Apennine.
But the Venetian had his free horizon, his salt breeze,
and sandy Lido-shore; sloped far and flat,&mdash;ridged sometimes
under the Tramontane winds with half a mile&rsquo;s breadth of rollers;&mdash;sea
and sand shrivelled up together in one yellow careering
field of fall and roar.</p>

<p>§ 3. They were, also, we said, always quarrelling with the
Pope. Their religious liberty came, like their bodily health,
from that wave-training; for it is one notable effect of a life
passed on shipboard to destroy weak beliefs in appointed forms of
religion. A sailor may be grossly superstitious, but his superstitions
will be connected with amulets and omens, not cast in
systems. He must accustom himself, if he prays at all, to pray
anywhere and anyhow. Candlesticks and incense not being portable
into the maintop, he perceives those decorations to be, on the
whole, inessential to a maintop mass. Sails must be set and
cables bent, be it never so strict a saint&rsquo;s day, and it is found that
no harm comes of it. Absolution on a lee-shore must be had of
the breakers, it appears, if at all, and they give it plenary and
brief, without listening to confession.</p>

<p>Whereupon our religious opinions become vague, but our religious
confidences strong; and the end of it all is that we perceive
the Pope to be on the other side of the Apennines, and able,
indeed, to sell indulgences, but not winds, for any money.
Whereas, God and the sea are with us, and we must even trust
them both, and take what they shall send.</p>

<p>§ 4. Then, farther. This ocean-work is wholly adverse to
any morbid conditions of sentiment. Reverie, above all things,
is forbidden by Scylla and Charybdis. By the dogs and the
depths, no dreaming! The first thing required of us is presence
of mind. Neither love, nor poetry, nor piety, must ever so take
up our thoughts as to make us slow or unready. In sweet Val
d&rsquo;Arno it is permissible enough to dream among the orange-blossoms,
and forget the day in twilight of ilex. But along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
avenues of the Adrian waves there can be no careless walking.
Vigilance, might and day, required of us, besides learning of many
practical lessons in severe and humble dexterities. It is enough
for the Florentine to know how to use his sword and to ride.
We Venetians, also, must be able to use our swords, and on
ground which is none of the steadiest; but, besides, we must be
able to do nearly everything that hands can turn to&mdash;rudders,
and yards, and cables, all needing workmanly handling and
workmanly knowledge, from captain as well as from men. To
drive a nail, lash a spear, reef a sail&mdash;rude work this for noble
hands; but to be done sometimes, and done well, on pain of
death. All which not only takes mean pride out of us, and puts
nobler pride of power in its stead; but it tends partly to soothe,
partly to chasten, partly to employ and direct, the hot Italian
temper, and make us every way greater, calmer, and happier.</p>

<p>§ 5. Moreover, it tends to induce in us great respect for the
whole human body; for its limbs, as much as for its tongue or
its wit. Policy and eloquence are well; and, indeed, we Venetians
can be politic enough, and can speak melodiously when
we choose; but to put the helm up at the right moment is the
beginning of all cunning&mdash;and for that we need arm and eye;&mdash;not
tongue. And with this respect for the body as such, comes
also the sailor&rsquo;s preference of massive beauty in bodily form.
The landsmen, among their roses and orange-blossoms, and
chequered shadows of twisted vine, may well please themselves
with pale faces, and finely drawn eyebrows, and fantastic braiding
of hair. But from the sweeping glory of the sea we learn to
love another kind of beauty; broad-breasted; level-browed, like
the horizon;&mdash;thighed and shouldered like the billows;&mdash;footed
like their stealing foam;&mdash;bathed in cloud of golden hair, like
their sunsets.</p>

<p>§ 6. Such were the physical influences constantly in operation
on the Venetians; their painters, however, were partly prepared
for their work by others in their infancy. Associations connected
with early life among mountains softened and deepened the
teaching of the sea; and the wildness of form of the Tyrolese
Alps gave greater strength and grotesqueness to their imaginations
than the Greek painters could have found among the cliffs
of the Ægean. Thus far, however, the influences on both are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
nearly similar. The Greek sea was indeed less bleak, and the
Greek hills less grand; but the difference was in degree rather
than in the nature of their power. The moral influences at work
on the two races were far more sharply opposed.</p>

<p>§ 7. Evil, as we saw, had been fronted by the Greek, and
thrust out of his path. Once conquered, if he thought of it
more, it was involuntarily, as we remember a painful dream, yet
with a secret dread that the dream might return and continue
for ever. But the teaching of the church in the middle ages had
made the contemplation of evil one of the duties of men. As
sin, it was to be duly thought upon, that it might be confessed.
As suffering, endured joyfully, in hope of future reward. Hence
conditions of bodily distemper which an Athenian would have
looked upon with the severest contempt and aversion, were in the
Christian church regarded always with pity, and often with
respect; while the partial practice of celibacy by the clergy, and
by those over whom they had influence,&mdash;together with the
whole system of conventual penance and pathetic ritual (with the
vicious reactionary tendencies necessarily following), introduced
calamitous conditions both of body and soul, which added largely
to the pagan&rsquo;s simple list of elements of evil, and introduced
the most complicated states of mental suffering and decrepitude.</p>

<p>§ 8. Therefore the Christian painters differed from the Greek
in two main points. They had been taught a faith which put an
end to restless questioning and discouragement. All was at last
to be well&mdash;and their best genius might be peacefully given to
imagining the glories of heaven and the happiness of its redeemed.
But on the other hand, though suffering was to cease in heaven,
it was to be not only endured, but honored upon earth. And
from the Crucifixion, down to a beggar&rsquo;s lameness, all the tortures
and maladies of men were to be made, at least in part, the
subjects of art. The Venetian was, therefore, in his inner mind,
less serious than the Greek: in his superficial temper, sadder.
In his heart there was none of the deep horror which vexed the
soul of Æschylus or Homer. His Pallas-shield was the shield of
Faith, not the shield of the Gorgon. All was at last to issue
happily; in sweetest harpings and seven-fold circles of light. But
for the present he had to dwell with the maimed and the blind,
and to revere Lazarus more than Achilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span></p>

<p>§ 9. This reference to a future world has a morbid influence
on all their conclusions. For the earth and all its natural
elements are despised. They are to pass away like a scroll. Man,
the immortal, is alone revered; his work and presence are all
that can be noble or desirable. Men, and fair architecture, temples
and courts such as may be in a celestial city, or the clouds
and angels of Paradise; these are what we must paint when we
want beautiful things. But the sea, the mountains, the forests,
are all adverse to us,&mdash;a desolation. The ground that was cursed
for our sake;&mdash;the sea that executed judgment on all our race,
and rages against us still, though bridled;&mdash;storm-demons churning
it into foam in nightly glare on Lido, and hissing from it
against our palaces. Nature is but a terror, or a temptation.
She is for hermits, martyrs, murderers,&mdash;for St. Jerome, and St.
Mary of Egypt, and the Magdalen in the desert, and monk Peter,
falling before the sword.</p>

<p>§ 10. But the worst point we have to note respecting the
spirit of Venetian landscape is its pride.</p>

<p>It was observed in the course of the third volume how the
mediæval temper had rejected agricultural pursuits, and whatever
pleasures could come of them.</p>

<p>At Venice this negation had reached its extreme. Though
the Florentines and Romans had no delight in farming, they had
in gardening. The Venetian possessed, and cared for, neither
fields nor pastures. Being delivered, to his loss, from all the
wholesome labors of tillage, he was also shut out from the sweet
wonders and charities of the earth, and from the pleasant natural
history of the year. Birds and beasts, and times and seasons, all
unknown to him. No swallow chattered at his window,<a name="fa1u" id="fa1u" href="#ft1u"><span class="sp">1</span></a> nor,
nested under his golden roofs, claimed the sacredness of his
mercy;<a name="fa2u" id="fa2u" href="#ft2u"><span class="sp">2</span></a> no Pythagorean fowl taught him the blessings of the
poor,<a name="fa3u" id="fa3u" href="#ft3u"><span class="sp">3</span></a> nor did the grave spirit of poverty rise at his side to set
forth the delicate grace and honor of lowly life.<a name="fa4u" id="fa4u" href="#ft4u"><span class="sp">4</span></a> No humble
thoughts of grasshopper sire had he, like the Athenian; no gratitude
for gifts of olive; no childish care for figs, any more than
thistles. The rich Venetian feast had no need of the figtree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
spoon.<a name="fa5u" id="fa5u" href="#ft5u"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Dramas about birds, and wasps, and frogs, would have
passed unheeded by his proud fancy; carol or murmur of them
had fallen unrecognized on ears accustomed only to grave syllables
of war-tried men, and wash of songless wave.</p>

<p>§ 11. No simple joy was possible to him. Only stateliness and
power; high intercourse with kingly and beautiful humanity,
proud thoughts, or splendid pleasures; throned sensualities, and
ennobled appetites. But of innocent, childish, helpful, holy
pleasures, he had none. As in the classical landscape, nearly all
rural labor is banished from the Titianesque: there is one bold
etching of a landscape, with grand ploughing in the foreground,
but this is only a caprice; the customary Venetian background is
without sign of laborious rural life. We find indeed often a
shepherd with his flock, sometimes a woman spinning, but no
division of fields, no growing crops nor nestling villages. In the
numerous drawings and woodcuts variously connected with or
representative of Venetian work, a watermill is a frequent object,
a river constant, generally the sea. But the prevailing idea in
all the great pictures I have seen, is that of mountainous land
with wild but graceful forest, and rolling or horizontal clouds.
The mountains are dark blue; the clouds glowing or soft gray,
always massive; the light, deep, clear, melancholy; the foliage,
neither intricate nor graceful, but compact and sweeping (with
undulated trunks), dividing much into horizontal flakes, like
the clouds; the ground rocky and broken somewhat monotonously,
but richly green with wild herbage; here and there a
flower, by preference white or blue, rarely yellow, still more
rarely red.</p>

<p>§ 12. It was stated that this heroic landscape of theirs was
peopled by spiritual beings of the highest order. And in this
rested the dominion of the Venetians over all later schools. They
were the <i>last believing</i> school of Italy. Although, as I said
above, always quarrelling with the Pope, there is all the more
evidence of an earnest faith in their religion. People who trusted
the Madonna less, flattered the Pope more. But down to Tintoret&rsquo;s
time, the Roman Catholic religion was still real and sincere
at Venice; and though faith in it was compatible with much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
which to us appears criminal or absurd, the religion itself was
entirely sincere.</p>

<p>§ 13. Perhaps when you see one of Titian&rsquo;s splendidly passionate
subjects, or find Veronese making the marriage in Cana
one blaze of worldly pomp, you imagine that Titian must have
been a sensualist, and Veronese an unbeliever.</p>

<p>Put the idea from you at once, and be assured of this for
ever;&mdash;it will guide you through many a labyrinth of life, as
well as of painting,&mdash;that of an evil tree, men never gather good
fruit&mdash;good of any sort or kind;&mdash;even good sensualism.</p>

<p>Let us look to this calmly. We have seen what physical advantage
the Venetian had, in his sea and sky; also what moral
disadvantage he had, in scorn of the poor; now finally, let us
see with what power he was invested, which men since his time
have never recovered more.</p>

<p>§ 14. &ldquo;Neither of a bramble bush, gather they grapes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great saying has twofold help for us. Be assured, first,
that if it were bramble from which you gathered them, these are
not grapes in your hand, though they look like grapes. Or if
these are indeed grapes, it was no bramble you gathered them
from, though it looked like one.</p>

<p>It is difficult for persons, accustomed to receive, without
questioning, the modern English idea of religion, to understand
the temper of the Venetian Catholics. I do not enter into examination
of our own feelings; but I have to note this one
significant point of difference between us.</p>

<p>§ 15. An English gentleman, desiring his portrait, gives probably
to the painter a choice of several actions, in any of which
he is willing to be represented. As for instance, riding his best
horse, shooting with his favorite pointer, manifesting himself in
his robes of state on some great public occasion, meditating in
his study, playing with his children, or visiting his tenants; in
any of these or other such circumstances, he will give the artist
free leave to paint him. But in one important action he would
shrink even from the suggestion of being drawn. He will assuredly
not let himself be painted praying.</p>

<p>Strangely, this is the action, which of all others, a Venetian
desires to be painted in. If they want a noble and complete
portrait, they nearly always choose to be painted on their knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span></p>

<p>§ 16. &ldquo;Hypocrisy,&rdquo; you say; and &ldquo;that they might be seen
of men.&rdquo; If we examine ourselves, or any one else, who will
give trustworthy answer on this point, so as to ascertain, to the
best of our judgment, what the feeling is, which would make a
modern English person dislike to be painted praying, we shall
not find it, I believe, to be excess of sincerity. Whatever we
find it to be, the opposite Venetian feeling is certainly not
hypocrisy. It is often conventionalism, implying as little devotion
in the person represented, as regular attendance at church
does with us. But that it is not hypocrisy, you may ascertain
by one simple consideration (supposing you not to have enough
knowledge of the expression of sincere persons to judge by the
portraits themselves). The Venetians, when they desired to deceive,
were much too subtle to attempt it clumsily. If they assumed
the mask of religion, the mask must have been of some
use. The persons whom it deceived must, therefore, have been
religious, and, being so, have believed in the Venetians&rsquo; sincerity.
If therefore, among other contemporary nations with
whom they had intercourse, we can find any, more religious than
they, who were duped, or even influenced, by their external religiousness,
we might have some ground for suspecting that religiousness
to be assumed. But if we can find no one likely to
have been deceived, we must believe the Venetian to have been,
in reality, what there was no advantage in seeming.</p>

<p>§ 17. I leave the matter to your examination, forewarning
you, confidently, that you will discover by severest evidence,
that the Venetian religion was true. Not only true, but one of
the main motives of their lives. In the field of investigation
to which we are here limited, I will collect some of the evidence
of this.</p>

<p>For one profane picture by great Venetians, you will find ten
of sacred subjects; and those, also, including their grandest,
most labored, and most beloved works. Tintoret&rsquo;s power culminates
in two great religious pictures: the Crucifixion, and the
Paradise. Titian&rsquo;s in the Assumption, the Peter Martyr, and
Presentation of the Virgin. Veronese&rsquo;s in the Marriage in Cana.
John Bellini and Basaiti never, so far as I remember, painted any
other than sacred subjects. By the Palmas, Vincenzo, Catena,
and Bonifazio, I remember no profane subject of importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span></p>

<p>§ 18. There is, moreover, one distinction of the very highest
import between the treatment of sacred subjects by Venetian
painters and by all others.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of Italy, piety had become abstract, and
opposed theoretically to worldly life; hence the Florentine and
Umbrian painters generally separated their saints from living
men. They delighted in imagining scenes of spiritual perfectness;&mdash;Paradises,
and companies of the redeemed at the judgment;&mdash;glorified
meetings of martyrs;&mdash;madonnas surrounded
by circles of angels. If, which was rare, definite portraitures of
living men were introduced, these real characters formed a kind
of chorus or attendant company, taking no part in the action.
At Venice all this was reversed, and so boldly as at first to shock,
with its seeming irreverence, a spectator accustomed to the formalities
and abstractions of the so-called sacred schools. The
madonnas are no more seated apart on their thrones, the saints
no more breathe celestial air. They are on our own plain ground&mdash;nay,
here in our houses with us. All kind of worldly business
going on in their presence, fearlessly; our own friends and respected
acquaintances, with all their mortal faults, and in their
mortal flesh, looking at them face to face unalarmed: nay, our
dearest children playing with their pet dogs at Christ&rsquo;s very feet.</p>

<p>I once myself thought this irreverent. How foolishly! As
if children whom He loved <i>could</i> play anywhere else.</p>

<p>§ 19. The picture most illustrative of this feeling is perhaps
that at Dresden, of Veronese&rsquo;s family, painted by himself.</p>

<p>He wishes to represent them as happy and honored. The
best happiness and highest honor he can imagine for them is
that they should be presented to the Madonna, to whom, therefore,
they are being brought by the three virtues&mdash;Faith, Hope,
and Charity.</p>

<p>The Virgin stands in a recess behind two marble shafts, such
as may be seen in any house belonging to an old family in
Venice. She places the boy Christ on the edge of a balustrade
before her. At her side are St. John the Baptist, and St.
Jerome. This group occupies the left side of the picture. The
pillars, seen sideways, divide it from the group formed by the
Virtues, with the wife and children of Veronese. He himself
stands a little behind, his hands clasped in prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span></p>

<p>§ 20. His wife kneels full in front, a strong Venetian woman,
well advanced in years. She has brought up her children in fear
of God, and is not afraid to meet the Virgin&rsquo;s eyes. She gazes
steadfastly on them; her proud head and gentle, self-possessed
face are relieved in one broad mass of shadow against a space of
light, formed by the white robes of Faith, who stands beside
her,&mdash;guardian, and companion. Perhaps a somewhat disappointing
Faith at the first sight, for her face is not in any way
exalted or refined. Veronese knew that Faith had to companion
simple and slow-hearted people perhaps oftener than able or
refined people&mdash;does not therefore insist on her being severely
intellectual, or looking as if she were always in the best company.
So she is only distinguished by her pure white (not
bright white) dress, her delicate hand, her golden hair drifted in
light ripples across her breast, from which the white robes fall
nearly in the shape of a shield&mdash;the shield of Faith. A little
behind her stands Hope; she also, at first, not to most people a
recognizable Hope. We usually paint Hope as young, and joyous.
Veronese knows better. That young hope is vain hope&mdash;passing
away in rain of tears; but the Hope of Veronese is aged,
assured, remaining when all else had been taken away. &ldquo;For
tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience
hope;&rdquo; and <i>that</i> hope maketh not ashamed.</p>

<p>She has a black veil on her head.</p>

<p>Then again, in the front, is Charity, red-robed; stout in the
arms,&mdash;a servant of all work, she; but small-headed, not being
specially given to thinking; soft-eyed, her hair braided brightly,
her lips rich red, sweet-blossoming. She has got some work to
do even now, for a nephew of Veronese&rsquo;s is doubtful about coming
forward, and looks very humbly and penitently towards the
Virgin&mdash;his life perhaps not having been quite so exemplary as
might at present be wished. Faith reaches her small white hand
lightly back to him, lays the tips of her fingers on his; but
Charity takes firm hold of him by the wrist from behind, and
will push him on presently, if he still hangs back.</p>

<p>§ 21. In front of the mother kneel her two eldest children, a
girl of about sixteen, and a boy a year or two younger. They
are both wrapt in adoration&mdash;the boy&rsquo;s being the deepest.
Nearer us, at their left side, is a younger boy, about nine years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
old&mdash;a black-eyed fellow, full of life&mdash;and evidently his father&rsquo;s
darling (for Veronese has put him full in light in the front;
and given him a beautiful white silken jacket, barred with black,
that nobody may ever miss seeing him to the end of time). He
is a little shy about being presented to the Madonna, and for
the present has got behind the pillar, blushing, but opening his
black eyes wide; he is just summoning courage to peep round,
and see if she looks kind. A still younger child, about six years
old, is really frightened, and has run back to his mother, catching
hold of her dress at the waist. She throws her right arm
round him and over him, with exquisite instinctive action, not
moving her eyes from the Madonna&rsquo;s face. Last of all, the
youngest child, perhaps about three years old, is neither frightened
nor interested, but finds the ceremony tedious, and is trying
to coax the dog to play with him; but the dog, which is one
of the little curly, short-nosed, fringy-pawed things, which all
Venetian ladies petted, will not now be coaxed. For the dog is
the last link in the chain of lowering feeling, and takes his doggish
views of the matter. He cannot understand, first, how the
Madonna got into the house; nor, secondly, why she is allowed
to stay, disturbing the family, and taking all their attention
from his dogship. And he is walking away, much offended.</p>

<p>§ 22. The dog is thus constantly introduced by the Venetians
in order to give the fullest contrast to the highest tones of
human thought and feeling. I shall examine this point presently
farther, in speaking of pastoral landscape and animal
painting; but at present we will merely compare the use of the
same mode of expression in Veronese&rsquo;s Presentation of the Queen
of Sheba.</p>

<p>§ 23. This picture is at Turin, and is of quite inestimable
value. It is hung high; and the really principal figure&mdash;the
Solomon, being in the shade, can hardly be seen, but is painted
with Veronese&rsquo;s utmost tenderness, in the bloom of perfect
youth, his hair golden, short, crisply curled. He is seated high
on his lion throne; two elders on each side beneath him, the
whole group forming a tower of solemn shade. I have alluded,
elsewhere, to the principle on which all the best composers act,
of supporting these lofty groups by some vigorous mass of
foundation. This column of noble shade is curiously sustained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
A falconer leans forward from the left-hand side, bearing on his
wrist a snow-white falcon, its wings spread, and brilliantly relieved
against the purple robe of one of the elders. It touches
with its wings one of the golden lions of the throne, on which
the light also flashes strongly; thus forming, together with it,
the lion and eagle symbol, which is the type of Christ throughout
mediæval work. In order to show the meaning of this symbol,
and that Solomon is typically invested with the Christian
royalty, one of the elders, by a bold anachronism, holds a jewel
in his hand of the shape of a cross, with which he (by accident
of gesture) points to Solomon; his other hand is laid on an open
book.</p>

<p>§ 24. The group opposite, of which the queen forms the
centre, is also painted with Veronese&rsquo;s highest skill; but contains
no point of interest bearing on our present subject, except
its connection by a chain of descending emotion. The Queen is
wholly oppressed and subdued; kneeling, and nearly fainting,
she looks up to Solomon with tears in her eyes; he, startled by
fear for her, stoops forward from the throne, opening his right
hand, as if to support her, so as almost to drop the sceptre. At
her side her first maid of honor is kneeling also, but does not
care about Solomon; and is gathering up her dress that it may
not be crushed; and looking back to encourage a negro girl,
who, carrying two toy-birds, made of enamel and jewels, for
presenting to the King, is frightened at seeing her Queen fainting,
and does not know what she ought to do; while lastly, the
Queen&rsquo;s dog, another of the little fringy-paws, is wholly unabashed
by Solomon&rsquo;s presence, or anybody else&rsquo;s; and stands
with his fore legs well apart, right in front of his mistress,
thinking everybody has lost their wits; and barking violently at
one of the attendants, who has set down a golden vase disrespectfully
near him.</p>

<p>§ 25. Throughout these designs I want the reader to notice
the purpose of representing things as they were likely to have
occurred, down to trivial, or even ludicrous detail&mdash;the nobleness
of all that was intended to be noble being so great that
nothing could detract from it. A farther instance, however,
and a prettier one, of this familiar realization, occurs in a Holy
Family, by Veronese, at Brussels. The Madonna has laid the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
infant Christ on a projecting base of pillar, and stands behind,
looking down on him. St. Catherine, having knelt down in
front, the child turns round to receive her&mdash;so suddenly, and so
far, that any other child must have fallen over the edge of the
stone. St. Catherine, terrified, thinking he is really going to
fall, stretches out her arms to catch him. But the Madonna
looking down, only smiles, &ldquo;He will not fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 26. A more touching instance of this realization occurs,
however, in the treatment of the saint Veronica (in the Ascent
to Calvary), at Dresden. Most painters merely represent her as
one of the gentle, weeping, attendant women; and show her
giving the handkerchief as though these women had been allowed
to approach Christ without any difficulty. But in Veronese&rsquo;s
conception, she has to break through the executioners to
him. She is not weeping; and the expression of pity, though
intense, is overborne by that of resolution. She is determined
to reach Christ; has set her teeth close, and thrusts aside one
of the executioners, who strikes fiercely at her with a heavy
doubled cord.</p>

<p>§ 27. These instances are enough to explain the general
character of the mind of Veronese, capable of tragic power to
the utmost, if he chooses to exert it in that direction, but, by
habitual preference, exquisitely graceful and playful; religious
without severity, and winningly noble; delighting in slight,
sweet, every-day incident, but hiding deep meanings underneath
it; rarely painting a gloomy subject, and never a base one.</p>

<p>§ 28. I have, in other places, entered enough into the examination
of the great religious mind of Tintoret; supposing
then that he was distinguished from Titian chiefly by this character.
But in this I was mistaken; the religion of Titian is
like that of Shakspere&mdash;occult behind his magnificent equity.
It is not possible, however, within the limits of this work, to
give any just account of the mind of Titian: nor shall I attempt
it; but will only explain some of those more strange and
apparently inconsistent attributes of it, which might otherwise
prevent the reader from getting clue to its real tone. The
first of these is its occasional coarseness in choice of type of
feature.</p>

<p>§ 29. In the second volume I had to speak of Titian&rsquo;s Magdalen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
in the Pitti Palace, as treated basely, and that in strong
terms, &ldquo;the disgusting Magdalen of the Pitti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Truly she is so as compared with the received types of the
Magdalen. A stout, redfaced woman, dull, and coarse of feature,
with much of the animal in even her expression of repentance&mdash;her
eyes strained, and inflamed with weeping. I ought,
however, to have remembered another picture of the Magdalen
by Titian (Mr. Rogers&rsquo;s, now in the National Gallery), in which
she is just as refined, as in the Pitti Palace she is gross; and
had I done so, I should have seen Titian&rsquo;s meaning. It had
been the fashion before his time to make the Magdalen always
young and beautiful; her, if no one else, even the rudest painters
flattered; her repentance was not thought perfect unless she
had lustrous hair and lovely lips. Titian first dared to doubt
the romantic fable, and reject the narrowness of sentimental
faith. He saw that it was possible for plain women to love no
less than beautiful ones; and for stout persons to repent as well
as those more delicately made. It seemed to him that the Magdalen
would have received her pardon not the less quickly because
her wit was none of the readiest; and would not have been
regarded with less compassion by her Master because her eyes
were swollen, or her dress disordered. It is just because he has
set himself sternly to enforce this lesson that the picture is so
painful: the only instance, so far as I remember, of Titian&rsquo;s
painting a woman markedly and entirely belonging to the lowest
class.</p>

<p>§ 30. It may perhaps appear more difficult to account for the
alternation of Titian&rsquo;s great religious pictures with others devoted
wholly to the expression of sensual qualities, or to exulting
and bright representation of heathen deities.</p>

<p>The Venetian mind, we have said, and Titian&rsquo;s especially, as
the central type of it, was wholly realist, universal, and manly.</p>

<p>In this breadth and realism, the painter saw that sensual passion
in man was, not only a fact, but a Divine fact; the human
creature, though the highest of the animals, was, nevertheless, a
perfect animal, and his happiness, health, and nobleness depended
on the due power of every animal passion, as well as the cultivation
of every spiritual tendency.</p>

<p>He thought that every feeling of the mind and heart, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
as every form of the body, deserved painting. Also to a painter&rsquo;s
true and highly trained instinct, the human body is the loveliest
of all objects. I do not stay to trace the reasons why, at Venice,
the female body could be found in more perfect beauty than the
male; but so it was, and it becomes the principal subject therefore,
both with Giorgione and Titian. They painted it fearlessly,
with all right and natural qualities; never, however, representing
it as exercising any overpowering attractive influence on
man; but only on the Faun or Satyr.</p>

<p>Yet they did this so majestically that I am perfectly certain
no untouched Venetian picture ever yet excited one base thought
(otherwise than in base persons anything may do so); while in
the greatest studies of the female body by the Venetians, all
other characters are overborne by majesty, and the form becomes
as pure as that of a Greek statue.</p>

<p>§ 31. There is no need, I should think, to point out how
this contemplation of the entire personal nature was reconcilable
with the severest conceptions of religious duty and faith.</p>

<p>But the fond introduction of heathen gods may appear less
explicable.</p>

<p>On examination, however, it will be found, that these deities
are never painted with any heart-reverence or affection. They
are introduced for the most part symbolically (Bacchus and Venus
oftenest, as incarnations of the spirit of revelry and beauty), of
course always conceived with deep imaginative truth, much resembling
the mode of Keats&rsquo;s conception; but never so as to
withdraw any of the deep devotion referred to the objects of
Christian faith.</p>

<p>In all its roots of power, and modes of work;&mdash;in its belief,
its breadth, and its judgment, I find the Venetian mind perfect.</p>

<p>How, then, did its art so swiftly pass away? How become,
what it became unquestionably, one of the chief causes of the
corruption of the mind of Italy, and of her subsequent decline in
moral and political power?</p>

<p>§ 32. By reason of one great, one fatal fault;&mdash;recklessness
in aim. Wholly noble in its sources, it was wholly unworthy in
its purposes.</p>

<p>Separate and strong, like Samson, chosen from its youth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
with the spirit of God visibly resting on it,&mdash;like him, it warred
in careless strength, and wantoned in untimely pleasure. No
Venetian painter ever worked with any aim beyond that of delighting
the eye, or expressing fancies agreeable to himself or
flattering to his nation. They could not be either unless they
were religious. But he did not desire the religion. He desired
the delight.</p>

<p>The Assumption is a noble picture, because Titian believed in
the Madonna. But he did not paint it to make any one else believe
in her. He painted it because he enjoyed rich masses of
red and blue, and faces flushed with sunlight.</p>

<p>Tintoret&rsquo;s Paradise is a noble picture, because he believed in
Paradise. But he did not paint it to make any one think of
heaven; but to form a beautiful termination for the hall of the
greater council.</p>

<p>Other men used their effete faiths and mean faculties with a
high moral purpose. The Venetian gave the most earnest faith,
and the lordliest faculty, to gild the shadows of an ante-chamber,
or heighten the splendors of a holiday.</p>

<p>§ 33. Strange, and lamentable as this carelessness may appear,
I find it to be almost the law with the great workers. Weak and
vain men have acute consciences, and labor under a profound
sense of responsibility. The strong men, sternly disdainful of
themselves, do what they can, too often merely as it pleases them
at the moment, reckless what comes of it.</p>

<p>I know not how far in humility, or how far in bitter and
hopeless levity, the great Venetians gave their art to be blasted
by the sea-winds or wasted by the worm. I know not whether
in sorrowful obedience, or in wanton compliance, they fostered
the folly, and enriched the luxury of their age. This only I
know, that in proportion to the greatness of their power was the
shame of its desecration and the suddenness of its fall. The enchanter&rsquo;s
spell, woven by centuries of toil, was broken in the
weakness of a moment; and swiftly, and utterly, as a rainbow
vanishes, the radiance and the strength faded from the wings of
the Lion.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="center chap2">DURER AND SALVATOR.</p>

<p class="center sc">&ldquo;EMIGRAVIT.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. By</span> referring to the first analysis of our subject, it will
be seen we have next to examine the art which cannot conquer
the evil, but remains at war with, or in captivity to it.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the Reformation it was possible for men
even of the highest powers of intellect to obtain a tranquillity of
faith, in the highest degree favorable to the pursuit of any particular
art. Possible, at least, we see it to have been; there is
no need&mdash;nor, so far as I see, any ground, for argument about it.
I am myself unable to understand how it was so; but the fact is
unquestionable. It is not that I wonder at men&rsquo;s trust in the
Pope&rsquo;s infallibility, or in his virtue; nor at their surrendering
their private judgment; nor at their being easily cheated by
imitations of miracles; nor at their thinking indulgences could
be purchased with money. But I wonder at this one thing only;
the acceptance of the doctrine of eternal punishment as dependent
on accident of birth, or momentary excitement of devotional
feeling. I marvel at the acceptance of the system (as stated in
its fulness by Dante) which condemned guiltless persons to the
loss of heaven because they had lived before Christ, and which
made the obtaining of Paradise turn frequently on a passing
thought or a momentary invocation. How this came to pass, it
is no part of our work here to determine. That in this faith, it
was possible to attain entire peace of mind; to live calmly, and
die hopefully, is indisputable.</p>

<p>§ 2. But this possibility ceased at the Reformation. Thenceforward
human life became a school of debate, troubled and
fearful. Fifteen hundred years of spiritual teaching were called
into fearful question, whether indeed it had been teaching by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
angels or devils? Whatever it had been, there was no longer
any way of trusting it peacefully.</p>

<p>A dark time for all men. We cannot now conceive it. The
great horror of it lay in this:&mdash;that, as in the trial-hour of the
Greek, the heavens themselves seemed to have deceived those
who had trusted in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had prayed with tears; we had loved with our hearts.
There was no choice of way open to us. No guidance from God
or man, other than this, and behold, it was a lie. &lsquo;When He,
the Spirit of Truth, is come, He shall guide you into all truth.&rsquo;
And He has guided us into <i>no</i> truth. There can be no such
Spirit. There is no Advocate, no Comforter. Has there been
no Resurrection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 3. Then came the Resurrection of Death. Never since
man first saw him, face to face, had his terror been so great.
&ldquo;Swallowed up in victory:&rdquo; alas! no; but king over all the
earth. All faith, hope, and fond belief were betrayed. Nothing
of futurity was now sure but the grave.</p>

<p>For the Pan-Athenaic Triumph and the Feast of Jubilee,
there came up, through fields of spring, the dance of Death.</p>

<p>The brood of weak men fled from the face of him. A new
Bacchus and his crew this, with worm for snake and gall for
wine. They recoiled to such pleasure as yet remained possible
to them&mdash;feeble infidelities, and luxurious sciences, and so went
their way.</p>

<p>§ 4. At least, of the men with whom we are concerned&mdash;the
artists&mdash;this was almost the universal fate. They gave themselves
to the following of pleasure only; and as a religious school,
after a few pale rays of fading sanctity from Guido, and brown
gleams of gipsy Madonnahood from Murillo, came utterly to an end.</p>

<p>Three men only stood firm, facing the new Dionysiac revel,
to see what would come of it.</p>

<p>Two in the north, Holbein and Durer, and, later, one in the
south, Salvator.</p>

<p>But the ground on which they stood differed strangely;
Durer and Holbein, amidst the formal delights, the tender religions,
and practical science, of domestic life and honest commerce.
Salvator, amidst the pride of lascivious wealth, and the outlawed
distress of impious poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span></p>

<p>§ 5. It would be impossible to imagine any two phases of
scenery or society more contrary in character, more opposite in
teaching, than those surrounding Nuremberg and Naples, in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. What they were then, both
districts still to all general intents remain. The cities have in
each case lost their splendor and power, but not their character.
The surrounding scenery remains wholly unchanged. It is still
in our power, from the actual aspect of the places, to conceive
their effect on the youth of the two painters.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:848px; height:574px" src="images/img312.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">76. The Moat of Nuremberg.</td></tr></table>

<p>§ 6. Nuremberg is gathered at the base of a sandstone rock,
rising in the midst of a dry but fertile plain. The rock forms a
prolonged and curved ridge, of which the concave side, at the
highest point, is precipitous; the other slopes gradually to the
plain. Fortified with wall and tower along its whole crest, and
crowned with a stately castle, it defends the city&mdash;not with its
precipitous side&mdash;but with its slope. The precipice is turned to
the town. It wears no aspect of hostility towards the surrounding
fields; the roads lead down into them by gentle descents
from the gates. To the south and east the walls are on the level
of the plain; within them, the city itself stands on two swells of
hill, divided by a winding river. Its architecture has, however,
been much overrated. The effect of the streets, so delightful to
the eye of the passing traveller, depends chiefly on one appendage
of the roof, namely, its warehouse windows. Every house,
almost without exception, has at least one boldly opening dormer
window, the roof of which sustains a pulley for raising goods;
and the underpart of this strong overhanging roof is always
carved with a rich pattern, not of refined design, but effective.<a name="fa1v" id="fa1v" href="#ft1v"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
Among these comparatively modern structures are mingled, however,
not unfrequently, others, turreted at the angles, which are
true Gothic of the fifteenth, some of the fourteenth, century;
and the principal churches remain nearly as in Durer&rsquo;s time.
Their Gothic is none of it good, nor even rich (though the
façades have their ornament so distributed as to give them a sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
elaborate effect at a distance); their size is diminutive;
their interiors mean, rude, and ill-proportioned, wholly dependent
for their interest on ingenious stone cutting in corners, and
finely-twisted ironwork; of these the mason&rsquo;s exercises are in the
worst possible taste, possessing not even the merit of delicate
execution; but the designs in metal are usually meritorious, and
Fischer&rsquo;s shrine of St. Sebald is good, and may rank with Italian
work.<a name="fa2v" id="fa2v" href="#ft2v"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>§ 7. Though, however, not comparable for an instant to any
great Italian or French city, Nuremberg possesses one character
peculiar to itself, that of a self-restrained, contented, quaint
domesticity. It would be vain to expect any first-rate painting,
sculpture, or poetry, from the well-regulated community of merchants
of small ware. But it is evident they were affectionate
and trustworthy&mdash;that they had playful fancy, and honorable
pride. There is no exalted grandeur in their city, nor any deep
beauty; but an imaginative homeliness, mingled with some elements
of melancholy and power, and a few even of grace.</p>

<p>This homeliness, among many other causes, arises out of one
in chief. The richness of the houses depends, as I just said, on
the dormer windows: but their deeper character on the pitch
and space of roofs. I had to notice long ago how much our
English cottage depended for expression on its steep roof. The
German house does so in far greater degree. Plate 76 is engraved<a name="fa3v" id="fa3v" href="#ft3v"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
from a slight pen-and-ink sketch of mine on the ramparts
of Nuremberg, showing a piece of its moat and wall, and a
little corner of the city beneath the castle; of which the tower
on the extreme right rises just in front of Durer&rsquo;s house. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
character of this scene approaches more nearly that which Durer
would see in his daily walks, than most of the modernized inner
streets. In Durer&rsquo;s own engraving, &ldquo;The Cannon,&rdquo; the distance
(of which the most important passage is facsimiled in my Elements
of Drawing, p. 111) is an actual portrait of part of the
landscape seen from those castle ramparts, looking towards
Franconian Switzerland.</p>

<p>§ 8. If the reader will be at the pains to turn to it, he will
see at a glance the elements of the Nuremberg country, as they
still exist. Wooden cottages, thickly grouped, enormously high
in the roofs; the sharp church spire, small and slightly grotesque,
surmounting them; beyond, a richly cultivated, healthy plain
bounded by woody hills. By a strange coincidence the very plant
which constitutes the staple produce of those fields, is in almost
ludicrous harmony with the grotesqueness and neatness of the
architecture around; and one may almost fancy that the builders
of the little knotted spires and turrets of the town, and workers
of its dark iron flowers, are in spiritual presence, watching and
guiding the produce of the field,&mdash;when one finds the footpaths
bordered everywhere, by the bossy spires and lustrous jetty flowers
of the black hollyhock.</p>

<p>§ 9. Lastly, when Durer penetrated among those hills of
Franconia he would find himself in a pastoral country, much resembling
the Gruyère districts of Switzerland, but less thickly
inhabited, and giving in its steep, though not lofty, rocks,&mdash;its
scattered pines,&mdash;and its fortresses and chapels, the motives of
all the wilder landscape introduced by the painter in such pieces
as his St. Jerome, or St. Hubert. His continual and forced introduction
of sea in almost every scene, much as it seems to me
to be regretted, is possibly owing to his happy recollections of
the sea-city where he received the rarest of all rewards granted
to a good workman; and, for once in his life, was understood.</p>

<p>§ 10. Among this pastoral simplicity and formal sweetness of
domestic peace, Durer had to work out his question concerning
the grave. It haunted him long; he learned to engrave death&rsquo;s
heads well before he had done with it; looked deeper than any
other man into those strange rings, their jewels lost; and gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
answer at last conclusively in his great Knight and Death&mdash;of
which more presently. But while the Nuremberg landscape is
still fresh in our minds, we had better turn south quickly and
compare the elements of education which formed, and of creation
which companioned, Salvator.</p>

<p>§ 11. Born with a wild and coarse nature (how coarse I will
show you soon), but nevertheless an honest one, he set himself
in youth hotly to the war, and cast himself carelessly on the
current of life. No rectitude of ledger-lines stood in his way;
no tender precision of household customs; no calm successions
of rural labor. But past his half-starved lips rolled profusion
of pitiless wealth; before him glared and swept the troops of
shameless pleasure. Above him muttered Vesuvius; beneath
his feet shook the Solfatara.</p>

<p>In heart disdainful, in temper adventurous; conscious of
power, impatient of labor, and yet more of the pride of the
patrons of his youth, he fled to the Calabrian hills, seeking, not
knowledge, but freedom. If he was to be surrounded by cruelty
and deceit, let them at least be those of brave men or savage
beasts, not of the timorous and the contemptible. Better the
wrath of the robber, than enmity of the priest; and the cunning
of the wolf than of the hypocrite.</p>

<p>§ 12. We are accustomed to hear the south of Italy spoken
of as a beautiful country. Its mountain forms are graceful
above others, its sea-bays exquisite in outline and hue; but it is
only beautiful in superficial aspect. In closer detail it is wild
and melancholy. Its forests are sombre-leafed, labyrinth-stemmed;
the carubbe, the olive, laurel, and ilex, are alike in
that strange feverish twisting of their branches, as if in spasms
of half human pain:&mdash;Avernus forests; one fears to break their
boughs, lest they should cry to us from their rents; the rocks
they shade are of ashes, or thrice-molten lava; iron sponge,
whose every pore has been filled with fire. Silent villages, earthquake-shaken,
without commerce, without industry, without
knowledge, without hope, gleam in white ruin from hill-side to
hill-side; far-winding wrecks of immemorial walls surround the
dust of cities long forsaken: the mountain streams moan
through the cold arches of their foundations, green with weed,
and rage over the heaps of their fallen towers. Far above, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
thunder-blue serration, stand the eternal edges of the angry Apennine,
dark with rolling impendence of volcanic cloud.</p>

<p>§ 13. Yet even among such scenes as these, Salvator might
have been calmed and exalted, had he been, indeed, capable of
exaltation. But he was not of high temper enough to perceive
beauty. He had not the sacred sense&mdash;the sense of color; all
the loveliest hues of the Calabrian air were invisible to him; the
sorrowful desolation of the Calabrian villages unfelt. He saw
only what was gross and terrible,&mdash;the jagged peak, the splintered
tree, the flowerless bank of grass, and wandering weed,
prickly and pale. His temper confirmed itself in evil, and became
more and more fierce and morose; though not, I believe,
cruel, ungenerous, or lascivious. I should not suspect Salvator
of wantonly inflicting pain. His constantly painting it does not
prove he delighted in it; he felt the horror of it, and in that horror,
fascination. Also, he desired fame, and saw that here was
an untried field rich enough in morbid excitement to catch the
humor of his indolent patrons. But the gloom gained upon
him, and grasped him. He could jest, indeed, as men jest in
prison-yards (he became afterwards a renowned mime in Florence);
his satires are full of good mocking, but his own doom to
sadness is never repealed.</p>

<p>§ 14. Of all men whose work I have ever studied, he gives
me most distinctly the idea of a lost spirit. Michelet calls him
&ldquo;Ce damné Salvator,&rdquo; perhaps in a sense merely harsh and violent;
the epithet to me seems true in a more literal, more merciful
sense,&mdash;&ldquo;That condemned Salvator.&rdquo; I see in him, notwithstanding
all his baseness, the last traces of spiritual life in
the art of Europe. He was the last man to whom the thought
of a spiritual existence presented itself as a conceivable reality.
All succeeding men, however powerful&mdash;Rembrandt, Rubens,
Vandyke, Reynolds&mdash;would have mocked at the idea of a spirit.
They were men of the world; they are never in earnest, and they
are never appalled. But Salvator was capable of pensiveness, of
faith, and of fear. The misery of the earth is a marvel to him;
he cannot leave off gazing at it. The religion of the earth is a
horror to him. He gnashes his teeth at it, rages at it, mocks
and gibes at it. He would have acknowledged religion, had he
seen any that was true. Anything rather than that baseness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
which he did see. &ldquo;If there is no other religion than this of
pope and cardinals, let us to the robber&rsquo;s ambush and the
dragon&rsquo;s den.&rdquo; He was capable of fear also. The gray spectre,
horse-headed, striding across the sky&mdash;(in the Pitti Palace)&mdash;its
bat wings spread, green bars of the twilight seen between its
bones; it was no play to him&mdash;the painting of it. Helpless Salvator!
A little early sympathy, a word of true guidance, perhaps,
had saved him. What says he of himself? &ldquo;Despiser of
wealth and of death.&rdquo; Two grand scorns; but, oh, condemned
Salvator! the question is not for man what he can scorn, but
what he can love.</p>

<p>§ 15. I do not care to trace the various hold which Hades
takes on this fallen soul. It is no part of my work here to analyze
his art, nor even that of Durer; all that we need to note is
the opposite answer they gave to the question about death.</p>

<p>To Salvator it came in narrow terms. Desolation, without
hope, throughout the fields of nature he had to explore; hypocrisy
and sensuality, triumphant and shameless, in the cities
from which he derived his support. His life, so far as any nobility
remained in it, could only pass in horror, disdain, or despair.
It is difficult to say which of the three prevails most in his common
work; but his answer to the great question was of despair
only. He represents &ldquo;Umana Fragilita&rdquo; by the type of a
skeleton with plumy wings, leaning over a woman and child;
the earth covered with ruin round them&mdash;a thistle, casting its
seed, the only fruit of it. &ldquo;Thorns, also, and thistles shall it
bring forth to thee.&rdquo; The same tone of thought marks all Salvator&rsquo;s
more earnest work.</p>

<p>§ 16. On the contrary, in the sight of Durer, things were for
the most part as they ought to be. Men did their work in his
city and in the fields round it. The clergy were sincere. Great
social questions unagitated; great social evils either non-existent,
or seemingly a part of the nature of things, and inevitable. His
answer was that of patient hope; and twofold, consisting of one
design in praise of Fortitude, and another in praise of Labor.
The Fortitude, commonly known as the &ldquo;Knight and Death,&rdquo;
represents a knight riding through a dark valley overhung by
leafless trees, and with a great castle on a hill beyond. Beside
him, but a little in advance, rides Death on a pale horse. Death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
is gray-haired and crowned;&mdash;serpents wreathed about his
crown; (the sting of death involved in the kingly power). He
holds up the hour-glass, and looks earnestly into the knight&rsquo;s
face. Behind him follows Sin; but Sin powerless; he has
been conquered and passed by, but follows yet, watching if any
way of assault remains. On his forehead are two horns&mdash;I think,
of sea-shell&mdash;to indicate his insatiableness and instability. He
has also the twisted horns of the ram, for stubbornness, the ears
of an ass, the snout of a swine, the hoofs of a goat. Torn wings
hang useless from his shoulders, and he carries a spear with two
hooks, for catching as well as wounding. The knight does not
heed him, nor even Death, though he is conscious of the presence
of the last.</p>

<p>He rides quietly, his bridle firm in his hand, and his lips set
close in a slight sorrowful smile, for he hears what Death is saying;
and hears it as the word of a messenger who brings pleasant
tidings, thinking to bring evil ones. A little branch of delicate
heath is twisted round his helmet. His horse trots proudly
and straight; its head high, and with a cluster of oak on the
brow where on the fiend&rsquo;s brow is the sea-shell horn. But the
horse of Death stoops its head; and its rein catches the little
bell which hangs from the knight&rsquo;s horse-bridle, making it toll,
as a passing bell.<a name="fa4v" id="fa4v" href="#ft4v"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>§ 17. Durer&rsquo;s second answer is the plate of &ldquo;Melencholia,&rdquo;
which is the history of the sorrowful toil of the earth, as the
&ldquo;Knight and Death&rdquo; is of its sorrowful patience under temptation.</p>

<p>Salvator&rsquo;s answer, remember, is in both respects that of despair.
Death as he reads, lord of temptation, is victor over the
spirit of man; and lord of ruin, is victor over the work of man.
Durer declares the sad, but unsullied conquest over Death the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
tempter; and the sad, but enduring conquest over Death the
destroyer.</p>

<p>§ 18. Though the general intent of the Melencholia is clear,
and to be felt at a glance, I am in some doubt respecting its
special symbolism. I do not know how far Durer intended to
show that labor, in many of its most earnest forms, is closely
connected with the morbid sadness, or &ldquo;dark anger,&rdquo; of the northern
nations. Truly some of the best work ever done for man,
has been in that dark anger;<a name="fa5v" id="fa5v" href="#ft5v"><span class="sp">5</span></a> but I have not yet been able to
determine for myself how far this is necessary, or how far great
work may also be done with cheerfulness. If I knew what the
truth was, I should be able to interpret Durer better; meantime
the design seems to me his answer to the complaint, &ldquo;Yet is his
strength labor and sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;but labor and sorrow are his strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 19. The labor indicated is in the daily work of men. Not
the inspired or gifted labor of the few (it is labor connected with
the sciences, not with the arts), shown in its four chief functions:
thoughtful, faithful, calculating and executing.</p>

<p>Thoughtful, first; all true power coming of that resolved,
resistless calm of melancholy thought. This is the first and last
message of the whole design. Faithful, the right arm of the
spirit resting on the book. Calculating (chiefly in the sense of
self-command), the compasses in her right hand. Executive&mdash;roughest
instruments of labor at her feet: a crucible, and geometrical
solids, indicating her work in the sciences. Over her
head the hour-glass and the bell, for their continual words,
&ldquo;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do.&rdquo; Beside her, childish
labor (lesson-learning?) sitting on an old millstone, with a tablet
on its knees. I do not know what instrument it has in its
hand. At her knees, a wolf-hound asleep. In the distance, a
comet (the disorder and threatening of the universe) setting, the
rainbow dominant over it. Her strong body is close girded for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
work; at her waist hang the keys of wealth; but the coin is cast
aside contemptuously under her feet. She has eagles&rsquo; wings, and
is crowned with fair leafage of spring.</p>

<p>Yes, Albert of Nuremberg, it was a noble answer, yet an imperfect
one. This is indeed the labor which is crowned with
laurel and has the wings of the eagle. It was reserved for
another country to prove, for another hand to portray, the labor
which is crowned with fire, and has the wings of the bat.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1v" id="ft1v" href="#fa1v"><span class="fn">1</span></a> To obtain room for the goods, the roofs slope steeply, and their other
dormer windows are richly carved&mdash;but all are of wood; and, for the most
part, I think, some hundred years later than Durer&rsquo;s time. A large number
of the oriel and bow windows on the façades are wooden also, and of
recent date.</p>

<p><a name="ft2v" id="ft2v" href="#fa2v"><span class="fn">2</span></a> His piece in the cathedral of Magdeburg is strangely inferior, wanting
both the grace of composition and bold handling of the St. Sebald&rsquo;s. The
bronze fountains at Nuremberg (three, of fame, in as many squares) are
highly wrought, and have considerable merit; the ordinary ironwork of the
houses, with less pretension, is, perhaps, more truly artistic. In Plate 52,
the right-hand figure is a characteristic example of the bell-handle at the door
of a private house, composed of a wreath of flowers and leafage twisted in a
spiral round an upright rod, the spiral terminating below in a delicate tendril;
the whole of wrought iron. It is longer than represented, some of
the leaf-links of the chain being omitted in the dotted spaces, as well as the
handle, which, though often itself of leafage, is always convenient for the
hand.</p>

<p><a name="ft3v" id="ft3v" href="#fa3v"><span class="fn">3</span></a> By Mr. Le Keux, very admirably.</p>

<p><a name="ft4v" id="ft4v" href="#fa4v"><span class="fn">4</span></a> This was first pointed out to me by a friend&mdash;Mr. Robin Allen. It is
a beautiful thought; yet, possibly, an after-thought, I have some suspicion
that there is an alteration in the plate at that place, and that the rope to
which the bell hangs was originally the line of the chest of the nearer horse,
as the grass-blades about the lifted hind leg conceal the lines which could
not, in Durer&rsquo;s way of work, be effaced, indicating its first intended position.

&ldquo;repentir&rdquo;!</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="center chap2">CLAUDE AND POUSSIN.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. It</span> was stated in the last chapter that Salvator was the
last painter of Italy on whom any fading trace of the old faithful
spirit rested. Carrying some of its passion far into the seventeenth
century, he deserved to be remembered together with the
painters whom the questioning of the Reformation had exercised,
eighty years before. Not so his contemporaries. The whole
body of painters around him, but chiefly those of landscape, had
cast aside all regard for the faith of their fathers, or for any
other; and founded a school of art properly called &ldquo;classical,&rdquo;<a name="fa1w" id="fa1w" href="#ft1w"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
of which the following are the chief characteristics.</p>

<p>§ 2. The belief in a supreme benevolent Being having ceased,
and the sense of spiritual destitution fastening on the mind, together
with the hopeless perception of ruin and decay in the
existing world, the imagination sought to quit itself from the
oppression of these ideas by realizing a perfect worldly felicity,
in which the inevitable ruin should at least be lovely, and the
necessarily short life entirely happy and refined. Labor must be
banished, since it was to be unrewarded. Humiliation and
degradation of body must be prevented since there could be no
compensation for them by preparation of the soul for another
world. Let us eat and drink (refinedly), for to-morrow we die,
and attain the highest possible dignity as men in this world,
since we shall have none as spirits in the next.</p>

<p>§ 3. Observe, this is neither the Greek nor the Roman spirit.
Neither Claude, nor Poussin, nor any other painter or writer,
properly termed &ldquo;classical,&rdquo; ever could enter into the Greek or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
Roman heart, which was as full, in many cases fuller, of the
hope of immortality than our own.</p>

<p>On the absence of belief in a good supreme Being, follows,
necessarily, the habit of looking to ourselves for supreme judgment
in all matters, and for supreme government. Hence, first,
the irreverent habit of judgment instead of admiration. It is
generally expressed under the justly degrading term &ldquo;good
taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 4. Hence, in the second place, the habit of restraint or self-government
(instead of impulsive and limitless obedience),
based upon pride, and involving, for the most part, scorn of the
helpless and weak, and respect only for the orders of men who
have been trained to this habit of self-government. Whence the
title classical, from the Latin <i>classicus</i>.</p>

<p>§ 5. The school is, therefore, generally to be characterized
as that of taste and restraint. As the school of taste, everything
is, in its estimation, beneath it, so as to be tasted or tested; not
above it, to be thankfully received. Nothing was to be fed upon
as bread; but only palated as a dainty. This spirit has destroyed
art since the close of the sixteenth century, and nearly destroyed
French literature, our English literature being at the same time
severely depressed, and our education (except in bodily strength)
rendered nearly nugatory by it, so far as it affects common-place
minds. It is not possible that the classical spirit should ever
take possession of a mind of the highest order. Pope is, as far
as I know, the greatest man who ever fell strongly under its
influence; and though it spoiled half his work, he broke through
it continually into true enthusiasm and tender thought.<a name="fa2w" id="fa2w" href="#ft2w"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Again,
as the school of reserve, it refuses to allow itself in any violent
or &ldquo;spasmodic&rdquo; passion; the schools of literature which have
been in modern times called &ldquo;spasmodic,&rdquo; being reactionary
against it. The word, though an ugly one, is quite accurate,
the most spasmodic books in the world being Solomon&rsquo;s Song,
Job, and Isaiah.</p>

<p>§ 6. The classical landscape, properly so called, is therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
the representative of perfectly trained and civilized human life,
associated with perfect natural scenery and with decorative
spiritual powers.</p>

<p>I will expand this definition a little.</p>

<p>1. Perfectly civilized human life; that is, life freed from the
necessity of humiliating labor, from passions inducing bodily
disease, and from abusing misfortune. The personages of the
classical landscape, therefore, must be virtuous and amiable; if
employed in labor, endowed with strength such as may make it
not oppressive. (Considered as a practicable ideal, the classical
life necessarily implies slavery, and the command, therefore, of
a higher order of men over a lower, occupied in servile work.)
Pastoral occupation is allowable as a contrast with city life.
War, if undertaken by classical persons, must be a contest for
honor, more than for life, not at all for wealth,<a name="fa3w" id="fa3w" href="#ft3w"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and free from
all fearful or debasing passion. Classical persons must be trained
in all the polite arts, and, because their health is to be perfect,
chiefly in the open air. Hence, the architecture around them
must be of the most finished kind, the rough country and ground
being subdued by frequent and happy humanity.</p>

<p>§ 7. 2. Such personages and buildings must be associated
with natural scenery, uninjured by storms or inclemency of
climate (such injury implying interruption of the open air life);
and it must be scenery conducing to pleasure, not to material
service; all cornfields, orchards, olive-yards, and such like, being
under the management of slaves,<a name="fa4w" id="fa4w" href="#ft4w"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and the superior beings having
nothing to do with them; but passing their lives under avenues
of scented and otherwise delightful trees&mdash;under picturesque
rocks, and by clear fountains.</p>

<p>§ 8. 3. The spiritual powers in classical scenery must be
decorative; ornamental gods, not governing gods; otherwise they
could not be subjected to the principles of taste, but would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
demand reverence. In order, therefore, as far as possible, without
taking away their supernatural power, to destroy their dignity,
they are made more criminal and capricious than men, and, for
the most part, those only are introduced who are the lords of
lascivious pleasures. For the appearance of any great god would
at once destroy the whole theory of the classical life; therefore,
Pan, Bacchus, and the Satyrs, with Venus and the Nymphs, are
the principal spiritual powers of the classical landscape. Apollo
with the Muses appear as the patrons of the liberal arts. Minerva
rarely presents herself (except to be insulted by judgment of
Paris); Juno seldom, except for some purpose of tyranny; Jupiter
seldom, but for purpose of amour.</p>

<p>§ 9. Such being the general ideal of the classical landscape, it
can hardly be necessary to show the reader how such charm as it
possesses must in general be strong only over weak or second-rate
orders of mind. It has, however, been often experimentally or
playfully aimed at by great men; but I shall only take note of
its two leading masters.</p>

<p>§ 10. I. Claude. As I shall have no farther occasion to refer
to this painter, I will resume, shortly, what has been said of him
throughout the work. He had a fine feeling for beauty of form
and considerable tenderness of perception. Vol. I., p. 76; vol.
III., p. 318. His aërial effects are unequalled. Vol. III., p. 318.
Their character appears to me to arise rather from a delicacy of
bodily constitution in Claude, than from any mental sensibility;
such as they are, they give a kind of feminine charm to his work,
which partly accounts for its wide influence. To whatever the
character may be traced, it reads him incapable of enjoying or
painting anything energetic or terrible. Hence the weakness of
his conceptions of rough sea. Vol. I., p. 77.</p>

<p>II. He had sincerity of purpose. Vol. III., p. 318. But in
common with other landscape painters of his day, neither earnestness,
humility, nor love, such as would ever cause him to forget
himself. Vol. I., p. 77.</p>

<p>That is to say, so far as he felt the truth, he tried to be true;
but he never felt it enough to sacrifice supposed propriety, or
habitual method to it. Very few of his sketches, and none of his
pictures, show evidence of interest in other natural phenomena
than the quiet afternoon sunshine which would fall methodically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
into a composition. One would suppose he had never seen scarlet
in a morning cloud, nor a storm burst on the Apennines. But
he enjoys a quiet misty afternoon in a ruminant sort of way (Vol.
III., p. 322), yet truly; and strives for the likeness of it, therein
differing from Salvator, who never attempts to be truthful, but
only to be impressive.</p>

<p>§ 11. III. His seas are the most beautiful in old art. Vol. I.,
p. 345. For he studied tame waves, as he did tame skies, with
great sincerity, and some affection; and modelled them with more
care not only than any other landscape painter of his day, but
even than any of the greater men; for they, seeing the perfect
painting of sea to be impossible, gave up the attempt, and
treated it conventionally. But Claude took so much pains about
this, feeling it was one of his <i>fortes</i>, that I suppose no one can
model a small wave better than he.</p>

<p>IV. He first set the pictorial sun in the pictorial heaven.
Vol. III., p. 318. We will give him the credit of this, with no
drawbacks.</p>

<p>V. He had hardly any knowledge of physical science (Vol. I.,
p. 76), and shows a peculiar incapacity of understanding the main
point of a matter. Vol. III., p. 321. Connected with which incapacity
is his want of harmony in expression. Vol. II., p. 151.
(Compare, for illustration of this, the account of the picture of
the Mill in the preface to Vol. I.)</p>

<p>§ 12. Such were the principal qualities of the leading painter
of classical landscape, his effeminate softness carrying him to dislike
all evidences of toil, or distress, or terror, and to delight in
the calm formalities which mark the school.</p>

<p>Although he often introduces romantic incidents and mediæval
as well as Greek or Roman personages, his landscape is always in
the true sense classic&mdash;everything being &ldquo;elegantly&rdquo; (selectingly
or tastefully), not passionately, treated. The absence of indications
of rural labor, of hedges, ditches, haystacks, ploughed fields,
and the like; the frequent occurrence of ruins of temples, or
masses of unruined palaces; and the graceful wildness of growth
in his trees, are the principal sources of the &ldquo;elevated&rdquo; character
which so many persons feel in his scenery.</p>

<p>There is no other sentiment traceable in his work than this
weak dislike to entertain the conception of toil or suffering.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
Ideas of relation, in the true sense, he has none; nor ever makes
an effort to conceive an event in its probable circumstances, but
fills his foregrounds with decorative figures, using commonest
conventionalism to indicate the subject he intends. We may take
two examples, merely to show the general character of such
designs of his.</p>

<p>§ 13. 1. St. George and the Dragon.</p>

<p>The scene is a beautiful opening in woods by a river side, a
pleasant fountain springs on the right, and the usual rich vegetation
covers the foreground. The dragon is about the size of ten
bramble leaves, and is being killed by the remains of a lance,
barely the thickness of a walking-stick, in his throat, curling his
tail in a highly offensive and threatening manner. St. George,
notwithstanding, on a prancing horse, brandishes his sword, at
about thirty yards&rsquo; distance from the offensive animal.</p>

<p>A semicircular shelf of rocks encircles the foreground, by
which the theatre of action is divided into pit and boxes. Some
women and children having descended unadvisedly into the pit,
are helping each other out of it again, with marked precipitation.
A prudent person of rank has taken a front seat in the boxes,&mdash;crosses
his legs, leans his head on his hand, and contemplates
the proceedings with the air of a connoisseur. Two attendants
stand in graceful attitudes behind him, and two more walk away
under the trees, conversing on general subjects.</p>

<p>§ 14. 2. Worship of the Golden Calf.</p>

<p>The scene is nearly the same as that of the St. George; but,
in order better to express the desert of Sinai, the river is much
larger, and the trees and vegetation softer. Two people, uninterested
in the idolatrous ceremonies, are rowing in a pleasure
boat on the river. The calf is about sixteen inches long (perhaps,
we ought to give Claude credit for remembering that it was made
of ear-rings, though he might as well have inquired how large
Egyptian ear-rings were). Aaron has put it on a handsome pillar,
under which five people are dancing, and twenty-eight, with
several children, worshipping. Refreshments for the dancers are
provided in four large vases under a tree on the left, presided
over by a dignified person holding a dog in a leash. Under the
distant group of trees appears Moses, conducted by some younger
personage (Nadab or Abihu). This younger personage holds up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
his hands, and Moses, in the way usually expected of him, breaks
the tables of the law, which are as large as an ordinary octavo
volume.</p>

<p>§ 15. I need not proceed farther, for any reader of sense or
ordinary powers of thought can thus examine the subjects of
Claude, one by one, for himself. We may quit him with these
few final statements concerning him.</p>

<p>The admiration of his works was legitimate, so far as it regarded
their sunlight effects and their graceful details. It was
base, in so far as it involved irreverence both for the deeper
powers of nature, and carelessness as to conception of subject.
Large admiration of Claude is wholly impossible in any period of
national vigor in art. He may by such tenderness as he possesses,
and by the very fact of his banishing painfulness, exercise considerable
influence over certain classes of minds; but this influence
is almost exclusively hurtful to them.</p>

<p>§ 16. Nevertheless, on account of such small sterling qualities
as they possess, and of their general pleasantness, as well as
their importance in the history of art, genuine Claudes must
always possess a considerable value, either as drawing-room ornaments
or museum relics. They may be ranked with fine pieces
of China manufacture, and other agreeable curiosities, of which
the price depends on the rarity rather than the merit, yet always
on a merit of a certain low kind.</p>

<p>§ 17. The other characteristic master of classical landscape is
Nicolo Poussin.</p>

<p>I named Claude first, because the forms of scenery he has
represented are richer and more general than Poussin&rsquo;s; but
Poussin has a far greater power, and his landscapes, though more
limited in material, are incomparably nobler than Claude&rsquo;s. It
would take considerable time to enter into accurate analysis of
Poussin&rsquo;s strong but degraded mind; and bring us no reward,
because whatever he has done has been done better by Titian.
His peculiarities are, without exception, weaknesses, induced in a
highly intellectual and inventive mind by being fed on medals,
books, and bassi-relievi instead of nature, and by the want of
any deep sensibility. His best works are his Bacchanalian revels,
always brightly wanton and wild, full of frisk and fire; but they
are coarser than Titian&rsquo;s, and infinitely less beautiful. In all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
minglings of the human and brutal character he leans on the
bestial, yet with a sternly Greek severity of treatment. This
restraint, peculiarly classical, is much too manifest in him; for,
owing to his habit of never letting himself be free, he does nothing
as well as it ought to be done, rarely even as well as he can
himself do it; and his best beauty is poor, incomplete, and
characterless, though refined. The Nymph pressing the honey
in the &ldquo;Nursing of Jupiter,&rdquo; and the Muse leaning against the
tree, in the &ldquo;Inspiration of Poet&rdquo; (both in the Dulwich Gallery),
appear to me examples of about his highest reach in this
sphere.</p>

<p>§ 18. His want of sensibility permits him to paint frightful
subjects, without feeling any true horror: his pictures of the
Plague, the Death of Polydectes, &amp;c., are thus ghastly in incident,
sometimes disgusting, but never impressive. The prominence
of the bleeding head in the Triumph of David marks the
same temper. His battle pieces are cold and feeble; his religious
subjects wholly nugatory, they do not excite him enough to
develop even his ordinary powers of invention. Neither does he
put much power into his landscape when it becomes principal;
the best pieces of it occur in fragments behind his figures.
Beautiful vegetation, more or less ornamental in character, occurs
in nearly all his mythological subjects, but his pure landscape is
notable only for its dignified reserve; the great squareness and
horizontality of its masses, with lowness of tone, giving it a
deeply meditative character. His Deluge might be much depreciated,
under this head of ideas of relation, but it is so uncharacteristic
of him that I pass it by. Whatever power this lowness
of tone, light in the distance, &amp;c., give to his landscape, or to
Gaspar&rsquo;s (compare Vol. II., Chapter on Infinity, § 12), is in both
conventional and artificial.</p>

<p>I have nothing, therefore, to add farther, here, to what was
said of him in Vol. I. (p. 89); and, as no other older masters of
the classical landscape are worth any special note, we will pass on
at once to a school of humbler but more vital power.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="center chap2">RUBENS AND CUYP.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. The</span> examination of the causes which led to the final departure
of the religious spirit from the hearts of painters, would
involve discussion of the whole scope of the Reformation on the
minds of persons unconcerned directly in its progress. This is of
course impossible.</p>

<p>One or two broad facts only can be stated, which the reader
may verify, if he pleases, by his own labor. I do not give them
rashly.</p>

<p>§ 2. The strength of the Reformation lay entirely in its being
a movement towards purity of practice.</p>

<p>The Catholic priesthood was hostile to it in proportion to the
degree in which they had been false to their own principles of
moral action, and had become corrupt or worldly in heart.</p>

<p>The Reformers indeed cast out many absurdities, and demonstrated
many fallacies, in the teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church. But they themselves introduced errors, which rent the
ranks, and finally arrested the march of the Reformation, and
which paralyze the Protestant Church to this day. Errors of
which the fatality was increased by the controversial bent which
lost accuracy of meaning in force of declamation, and turned expressions,
which ought to be used only in retired depth of
thought, into phrases of custom, or watchwords of attack.
Owing to which habits of hot, ingenious, and unguarded controversy,
the Reformed churches themselves soon forgot the
meaning of the word which, of all words, was oftenest in their
mouths. They forgot that <span class="grk" title="pistis">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> is a derivative of <span class="grk" title="peithomai">&#960;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>,
not of <span class="grk" title="pisteuô">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</span>, and that &ldquo;fides,&rdquo; closely connected with &ldquo;fio&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
on one side, and with &ldquo;confido&rdquo; on the other, is but distantly
related to &ldquo;credo.&rdquo;<a name="fa1x" id="fa1x" href="#ft1x"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>§ 3. By whatever means, however, the reader may himself be
disposed to admit, the Reformation <i>was</i> arrested; and got itself
shut up into chancels of cathedrals in England (even those, generally
too large for it), and into conventicles everywhere else.
Then rising between the infancy of Reformation, and the palsy
of Catholicism;&mdash;between a new shell of half-built religion on
one side, daubed with untempered mortar, and a falling ruin of
outworn religion on the other, lizard-crannied, and ivy-grown;&mdash;rose,
on its independent foundation, the faithless and materialized
mind of modern Europe&mdash;ending in the rationalism of Germany,
the polite formalism of England, the careless blasphemy of France,
and the helpless sensualities of Italy; in the midst of which,
steadily advancing science, and the charities of more and more
widely extended peace, are preparing the way for a Christian
church, which shall depend neither on ignorance for its continuance,
nor on controversy for its progress; but shall reign at once
in light, and love.</p>

<p>§ 4. The whole body of painters (such of them as were left)
necessarily fell into the rationalistic chasm. The Evangelicals
despised the arts, while the Roman Catholics were effete or insincere,
and could not retain influence over men of strong reasoning
power.</p>

<p>The painters could only associate frankly with men of the
world, and themselves became men of the world. Men, I mean,
having no belief in spiritual existences; no interests or affections
beyond the grave.</p>

<p>§ 5. Not but that they still painted scriptural subjects. Altar-pieces
were wanted occasionally, and pious patrons sometimes
commissioned a cabinet Madonna. But there is just this difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
between the men of this modern period, and the Florentines
or Venetians&mdash;that whereas the latter never exert themselves
fully except on a sacred subject, the Flemish and Dutch masters
are always languid unless they are profane. Leonardo is only to
be seen in the Cena; Titian only in the Assumption; but Rubens
only in the Battle of the Amazons, and Vandyck only at court.</p>

<p>§ 6. Altar-pieces, when wanted, of course either of them will
supply as readily as anything else. Virgins in blue,<a name="fa2x" id="fa2x" href="#ft2x"><span class="sp">2</span></a> or St. Johns
in red,<a name="fa3x" id="fa3x" href="#ft3x"><span class="sp">3</span></a> as many as you please. Martyrdoms also, by all means:
Rubens especially delights in these. St. Peter, head downwards,<a name="fa4x" id="fa4x" href="#ft4x"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
is interesting anatomically; writhings of impenitent thieves, and
bishops having their tongues pulled out, display our powers to
advantage, also.<a name="fa5x" id="fa5x" href="#ft5x"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Theological instruction, if required: &ldquo;Christ
armed with thunder, to destroy the world, spares it at the intercession
of St. Francis.&rdquo;<a name="fa6x" id="fa6x" href="#ft6x"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Last Judgments even, quite Michael-Angelesque,
rich in twistings of limbs, with spiteful biting, and
scratching; and fine aërial effects in smoke of the pit.<a name="fa7x" id="fa7x" href="#ft7x"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>§ 7. In all this, however, there is not a vestige of religious
feeling or reverence. We have even some visible difficulty in
meeting our patron&rsquo;s pious wishes. Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den is
indeed an available subject, but duller than a lion hunt; and
Mary of Nazareth must be painted, if an order come for her;
but (says polite Sir Peter), Mary of Medicis, or Catherine, her
bodice being fuller, and better embroidered, would, if we might
offer a suggestion, probably give greater satisfaction.</p>

<p>§ 8. No phenomenon in human mind is more extraordinary
than the junction of this cold and worldly temper with great
rectitude of principle, and tranquil kindness of heart. Rubens
was an honorable and entirely well-intentioned man, earnestly
industrious, simple and temperate in habits of life, high-bred,
learned, and discreet. His affection for his mother was great;
his generosity to contemporary artists unfailing. He is a healthy,
worthy, kind-hearted, courtly-phrased&mdash;Animal&mdash;without any
clearly perceptible traces of a soul, except when he paints his
children. Few descriptions of pictures could be more ludicrous
in their pure animalism than those which he gives of his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
&ldquo;It is a subject,&rdquo; he writes to Sir D. Carleton, &ldquo;neither sacred
nor profane, although taken from Holy Writ, namely, Sarah in
the act of scolding Hagar, who, pregnant, is leaving the house in
a feminine and graceful manner, assisted by the patriarch Abram.&rdquo;
(What a graceful apology, by the way, instantly follows, for not
having finished the picture himself.) &ldquo;I have engaged, as is my
custom, a very skilful man in his pursuit to finish the landscapes
solely to augment the enjoyment of Y. E.!&rdquo;<a name="fa8x" id="fa8x" href="#ft8x"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>Again, in priced catalogue,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;50 florins each.&mdash;The Twelve Apostles, with a Christ. Done
by my scholars, from originals by my own hand, each having to
be retouched by my hand throughout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;600 florins.&mdash;A picture of Achilles clothed as a woman;
done by the best of my scholars, and the whole retouched by my
hand; a most brilliant picture, and full of many beautiful young
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 9. Observe, however, Rubens is always entirely honorable
in his statements of what is done by himself and what not. He
is religious, too, after his manner; hears mass every morning, and
perpetually uses the phrase &ldquo;by the grace of God,&rdquo; or some other
such, in writing of any business he takes in hand; but the tone
of his religion may be determined by one fact.</p>

<p>We saw how Veronese painted himself and his family, as
worshipping the Madonna.</p>

<p>Rubens has also painted himself and his family in an equally
elaborate piece. But they are not <i>worshipping</i> the Madonna.
They are <i>performing</i> the Madonna, and her saintly entourage.
His favorite wife &ldquo;En Madone;&rdquo; his youngest boy &ldquo;as Christ;&rdquo;
his father-in-law (or father, it matters not which) &ldquo;as Simeon;&rdquo;
another elderly relation, with a beard, &ldquo;as St. Jerome;&rdquo; and he
himself &ldquo;as St. George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 10. Rembrandt has also painted (it is, on the whole, his
greatest picture, so far as I have seen) himself and his wife in a
state of ideal happiness. He sits at supper with his wife on his
knee, flourishing a glass of champagne, with a roast peacock on
the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span></p>

<p>The Rubens is in the Church of St. James at Antwerp; the
Rembrandt at Dresden&mdash;marvellous pictures, both. No more
precious works by either painter exist. Their hearts, such as
they have, are entirely in them; and the two pictures, not inaptly,
represent the Faith and Hope of the 17th century. We have to
stoop somewhat lower, in order to comprehend the pastoral and
rustic scenery of Cuyp and Teniers, which must yet be held as
forming one group with the historical art of Rubens, being
connected with it by Rubens&rsquo; pastoral landscape. To these, I
say, we must stoop lower; for they are destitute, not of spiritual
character only, but of spiritual thought.</p>

<p>Rubens often gives instructive and magnificent allegory;
Rembrandt, pathetic or powerful fancies, founded on real scripture
reading, and on his interest in the picturesque character of the
Jew. And Vandyck, a graceful dramatic rendering of received
scriptural legends.</p>

<p>But in the pastoral landscape we lose, not only all faith in
religion, but all remembrance of it. Absolutely now at last we
find ourselves without sight of God in all the world.</p>

<p>§ 11. So far as I can hear or read, this is an entirely new and
wonderful state of things achieved by the Hollanders. The
human being never got wholly quit of the terror of spiritual being
before. Persian, Egyptian, Assyrian, Hindoo, Chinese, all
kept some dim, appalling record of what they called &ldquo;gods.&rdquo;
Farthest savages had&mdash;and still have&mdash;their Great Spirit, or, in
extremity, their feather idols, large-eyed; but here in Holland
we have at last got utterly done with it all. Our only idol glitters
dimly, in tangible shape of a pint pot, and all the incense
offered thereto, comes out of a small censer or bowl at the end of
a pipe. Of deities or virtues, angels, principalities, or powers, in
the name of our ditches, no more. Let us have cattle, and
market vegetables.</p>

<p>This is the first and essential character of the Holland landscape
art. Its second is a worthier one; respect for rural life.</p>

<p>§ 12. I should attach greater importance to this rural feeling,
if there were any true humanity in it, or any feeling for beauty.
But there is neither. No incidents of this lower life are painted
for the sake of the incidents, but only for the effects of light.
You will find that the best Dutch painters do not care about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
people, but about the lustres on them. Paul Potter, their best
herd and cattle painter, does not care even for sheep, but only for
wool; regards not cows, but cowhide. He attains great dexterity
in drawing tufts and locks, lingers in the little parallel ravines
and furrows of fleece that open across sheep&rsquo;s backs as they turn;
is unsurpassed in twisting a horn or pointing a nose; but he
cannot paint eyes, nor perceive any condition of an animal&rsquo;s mind,
except its desire of grazing. Cuyp can, indeed, paint sunlight,
the best that Holland&rsquo;s sun can show; he is a man of large natural
gift, and sees broadly, nay, even seriously; finds out&mdash;a
wonderful thing for men to find out in those days&mdash;that there are
reflections in water, and that boats require often to be painted
upside down. A brewer by trade, he feels the quiet of a summer
afternoon, and his work will make you marvellously drowsy. It
is good for nothing else that I know of: strong; but unhelpful
and unthoughtful. Nothing happens in his pictures, except
some indifferent person&rsquo;s asking the way of somebody else, who,
by their cast of countenance, seems not likely to know it. For
farther entertainment perhaps a red cow and a white one; or
puppies at play, not playfully; the man&rsquo;s heart not going even
with the puppies. Essentially he sees nothing but the shine on
the flaps of their ears.</p>

<p>§ 13. Observe always, the fault lies not in the thing&rsquo;s being
little, or the incident being slight. Titian could have put issues
of life and death into the face of a man asking the way; nay,
into the back of him, if he had so chosen. He has put a whole
scheme of dogmatic theology into a row of bishops&rsquo; backs at the
Louvre. And for dogs, Velasquez has made some of them nearly
as grand as his surly kings.</p>

<p>Into the causes of which grandeur we must look a little, with
respect not only to these puppies, and gray horses, and cattle of
Cuyp, but to the hunting pieces of Rubens and Snyders. For
closely connected with the Dutch rejection of motives of spiritual
interest, is the increasing importance attached by them to animals,
seen either in the chase or in agriculture; and to judge
justly of the value of this animal painting it will be necessary
for us to glance at that of earlier times.</p>

<p>§ 14. And first of the animals which have had more influence
over the human soul, in its modern life, than ever Apis or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
crocodile had over Egyptian&mdash;the dog and horse. I stated, in
speaking of Venetian religion, that the Venetians always introduced
the dog as a contrast to the high aspects of humanity.
They do this, not because they consider him the basest of animals,
but the highest&mdash;the connecting link between men and
animals; in whom the lower forms of really human feeling may
be best exemplified, such as conceit, gluttony, indolence, petulance.
But they saw the noble qualities of the dog, too;&mdash;all his
patience, love, and faithfulness; therefore Veronese, hard as he is
often on lap-dogs, has painted one great heroic poem on the dog.</p>

<p>§ 15. Two mighty brindled mastiffs, and beyond them, darkness.
You scarcely see them at first, against the gloomy green.
No other sky for them&mdash;poor things. They are gray themselves,
spotted with black all over; their multitudinous doggish vices
may not be washed out of them,&mdash;are in grain of nature. Strong
thewed and sinewed, however,&mdash;no blame on them as far as
bodily strength may reach; their heads coal-black, with drooping
ears and fierce eyes, bloodshot a little. Wildest of beasts perhaps
they would have been, by nature. But between them stands the
spirit of their human Love, dove-winged and beautiful, the resistless
Greek boy, golden-quivered; his glowing breast and limbs
the only light upon the sky,&mdash;purple and pure. He has cast his
chain about the dogs&rsquo; necks, and holds it in his strong right
hand, leaning proudly a little back from them. They will never
break loose.</p>

<p>§ 16. This is Veronese&rsquo;s highest, or spiritual view of the dog&rsquo;s
nature. He can only give this when looking at the creature
alone. When he sees it in company with men, he subdues it,
like an inferior light in presence of the sky; and generally then
gives it a merely brutal nature, not insisting even on its affection.
It is thus used in the Marriage in Cana to symbolize gluttony.
That great picture I have not yet had time to examine in all its
bearings of thought; but the chief purpose of it is, I believe, to
express the pomp and pleasure of the world, pursued without
thought of the presence of Christ; therefore the Fool with the
bells is put in the centre, immediately underneath the Christ;
and in front are the couple of dogs in leash, one gnawing a bone.
A cat lying on her back scratches at one of the vases which hold
the wine of the miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span></p>

<p>§ 17. In the picture of Susannah, her little pet dog is merely
doing his duty, barking at the Elders. But in that of the Magdalen
(at Turin) a noble piece of bye-meaning is brought out by
a dog&rsquo;s help. On one side is the principal figure, the Mary washing
Christ&rsquo;s feet; on the other, a dog has just come out from beneath
the table (the dog under the table eating of the crumbs),
and in doing so, has touched the robe of one of the Pharisees,
thus making it unclean. The Pharisee gathers up his robe in a
passion, and shows the hem of it to a bystander, pointing to the
dog at the same time.</p>

<p>§ 18. In the Supper at Emmaus, the dog&rsquo;s affection is, however,
fully dwelt upon. Veronese&rsquo;s own two little daughters are
playing, on the hither side of the table, with a great wolf-hound,
larger than either of them. One with her head down, nearly
touching his nose, is talking to him,&mdash;asking him questions it
seems, nearly pushing him over at the same time:&mdash;the other,
raising her eyes, half archly, half dreamily,&mdash;some far-away
thought coming over her,&mdash;leans against him on the other side,
propping him with her little hand, laid slightly on his neck. He,
all passive, and glad at heart, yielding himself to the pushing or
sustaining hand, looks earnestly into the face of the child close
to his; would answer her with the gravity of a senator, if so it
might be:&mdash;can only look at her, and love her.</p>

<p>§ 19. To Velasquez and Titian dogs seem less interesting
than to Veronese; they paint them simply as noble brown beasts,
but without any special character; perhaps Velasquez&rsquo;s dogs are
sterner and more threatening than the Venetian&rsquo;s, as are also his
kings and admirals. This fierceness in the animal increases, as
the spiritual power of the artist declines; and, with the fierceness,
another character. One great and infallible sign of the
absence of spiritual power is the presence of the slightest taint of
obscenity. Dante marked this strongly in all his representations
of demons, and as we pass from the Venetians and Florentines to
the Dutch, the passing away of the soul-power is indicated by
every animal becoming savage or foul. The dog is used by
Teniers, and many other Hollanders, merely to obtain unclean
jest; while by the more powerful men, Rubens, Snyders, Rembrandt,
it is painted only in savage chase, or butchered agony. I
know no pictures more shameful to humanity than the boar and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
lion hunts of Rubens and Snyders, signs of disgrace all the deeper,
because the powers desecrated are so great. The painter of the
village ale-house sign may, not dishonorably, paint the fox-hunt
for the village squire; but the occupation of magnificent art-power
in giving semblance of perpetuity to those bodily pangs
which Nature has mercifully ordained to be transient, and in
forcing us, by the fascination of its stormy skill, to dwell on that
from which eyes of merciful men should instinctively turn away,
and eyes of high-minded men scornfully, is dishonorable, alike
in the power which it degrades, and the joy to which it betrays.</p>

<p>§ 20. In our modern treatment of the dog, of which the prevailing
tendency is marked by Landseer, the interest taken in
him is disproportionate to that taken in man, and leads to a
somewhat trivial mingling of sentiment, or warping by caricature;
giving up the true nature of the animal for the sake of a
pretty thought or pleasant jest. Neither Titian nor Velasquez
ever jest; and though Veronese jests gracefully and tenderly, he
never for an instant oversteps the absolute facts of nature. But
the English painter looks for sentiment or jest primarily, and
reaches both by a feebly romantic taint of fallacy, except in one
or two simple and touching pictures, such as the Shepherd&rsquo;s
Chief Mourner.</p>

<p>I was pleased by a little unpretending modern German picture
at Dusseldorf, by E. Bosch, representing a boy carving a model
of his sheep-dog in wood; the dog sitting on its haunches in
front of him, watches the progress of the sculpture with a grave
interest and curiosity, not in the least caricatured, but highly
humorous. Another small picture, by the same artist, of a forester&rsquo;s
boy being taught to shoot by his father,&mdash;the dog critically
and eagerly watching the raising of the gun,&mdash;shows equally
true sympathy.</p>

<p>§ 21. I wish I were able to trace any of the leading circumstances
in the ancient treatment of the horse, but I have no
sufficient data. Its function in the art of the Greeks is connected
with all their beautiful fable philosophy; but I have not
a tithe of the knowledge necessary to pursue the subject in this
direction. It branches into questions relating to sacred animals,
and Egyptian and Eastern mythology. I believe the Greek
interest in <i>pure</i> animal character corresponded closely to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
own, except that it is less sentimental, and either distinctly true
or distinctly fabulous; not hesitating between truth and falsehood.
Achilles&rsquo; horses, like Anacreon&rsquo;s dove, and Aristophanes&rsquo;
frogs and birds, speak clearly out, if at all. They do not become
feebly human, by fallacies and exaggerations, but frankly
and wholly.</p>

<p>Zeuxis&rsquo; picture of the Centaur indicates, however, a more
distinctly sentimental conception; and I suppose the Greek
artists always to have fully appreciated the horse&rsquo;s fineness of
temper and nervous constitution.<a name="fa9x" id="fa9x" href="#ft9x"><span class="sp">9</span></a> They seem, by the way,
hardly to have done justice to the dog. My pleasure in the
entire Odyssey is diminished because Ulysses gives not a word of
kindness or of regret to Argus.</p>

<p>§ 22. I am still less able to speak of Roman treatment of
the horse. It is very strange that in the chivalric ages, he is
despised; their greatest painters drawing him with ludicrous
neglect. The Venetians, as was natural, painted him little and
ill; but he becomes important in the equestrian statues of the
fifteenth and sixteenth century, chiefly, I suppose, under the
influence of Leonardo.</p>

<p>I am not qualified to judge of the merit of these equestrian
statues; but, in painting, I find that no real interest is taken in
the horse until Vandyck&rsquo;s time, he and Rubens doing more for
it than all previous painters put together. Rubens was a good
rider, and rode nearly every day, as, I doubt not, Vandyck also.
Some notice of an interesting equestrian picture of Vandyck&rsquo;s
will be found in the next chapter. The horse has never, I
think, been painted worthily again, since he died.<a name="fa10x" id="fa10x" href="#ft10x"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Of the influence
of its unworthy painting, and unworthy use, I do not at
present care to speak, noticing only that it brought about in England
the last degradations of feeling  and of art. The Dutch,
indeed, banished all deity from the earth; but I think only in
England has death-bed consolation been sought in a fox&rsquo;s tail.<a name="fa11x" id="fa11x" href="#ft11x"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span></p>

<p>I wish, however, the reader distinctly to understand that the
expressions of reprobation of field-sports which he will find
scattered through these volumes,&mdash;and which, in concluding
them, I wish I had time to collect and farther enforce&mdash;refer
only to the chase and the turf; that is to say, to hunting, shooting,
and horse-racing, but not to athletic exercises. I have just
as deep a respect for boxing, wrestling, cricketing, and rowing,
as contempt of all the various modes of wasting wealth, time,
land, and energy of soul, which have been invented by the pride
and selfishness of men, in order to enable them to be healthy in
uselessness, and get quit of the burdens of their own lives, without
condescending to make them serviceable to others.</p>

<p>§ 23. Lastly, of cattle.</p>

<p>The period when the interest of men began to be transferred
from the ploughman to his oxen is very distinctly marked
by Bassano. In him the descent is even greater, being, accurately,
from the Madonna to the Manger&mdash;one of perhaps his
best pictures (now, I believe, somewhere in the north of England),
representing an adoration of shepherds with nothing to
adore, they and their herds forming the subject, and the Christ
being &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; at the side. From that time cattle-pieces
become frequent, and gradually form a staple art commodity.
Cuyp&rsquo;s are the best; nevertheless, neither by him nor any one
else have I ever seen an entirely well-painted cow. All the men
who have skill enough to paint cattle nobly, disdain them. The
real influence of these Dutch cattle-pieces, in subsequent art, is
difficult to trace, and is not worth tracing. They contain a certain
healthy appreciation of simple pleasure which I cannot look
upon wholly without respect. On the other hand, their cheap
tricks of composition degraded the entire technical system of
landscape; and their clownish and blunt vulgarities too long
blinded us, and continue, so far as in them lies, to blind us yet,
to all the true refinement and passion of rural life. There have
always been truth and depth of pastoral feeling in the works of
great poets and novelists; but never, I think, in painting, until
lately. The designs of J. C. Hook are, perhaps, the only works
of the kind in existence which deserve to be mentioned in connection
with the pastorals of Wordsworth and Tennyson.</p>

<p>We must not, however, yet pass to the modern school, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
still to examine the last phase of Dutch design, in which the
vulgarities which might be forgiven to the truth of Cuyp, and
forgotten in the power of Rubens, became unpardonable and
dominant in the works of men who were at once affected and
feeble. But before doing this, we must pause to settle a preliminary
question, which is an important and difficult one, and
will need a separate chapter; namely, What is vulgarity itself?</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1x" id="ft1x" href="#fa1x"><span class="fn">1</span></a> None of our present forms of opinion are more curious than those which
have developed themselves from this verbal carelessness. It never seems to
strike any of our religious teachers, that if a child has a father living, it
either <i>knows</i> it has a father, or does not: it does not &ldquo;believe&rdquo; it has a
father. We should be surprised to see an intelligent child standing at its
garden gate, crying out to the passers-by: &ldquo;I believe in my father, because
he built this house;&rdquo; as logical people proclaim that they believe in God,
because He must have made the world.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="center chap2">OF VULGARITY.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Two</span> great errors, coloring, or rather discoloring, severally,
the minds of the higher and lower classes, have sown
wide dissension, and wider misfortune, through the society of
modern days. These errors are in our modes of interpreting the
word &ldquo;gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Its primal, literal, and perpetual meaning is &ldquo;a man of pure
race;&rdquo; well bred, in the sense that a horse or dog is well bred.</p>

<p>The so-called higher classes, being generally of purer race
than the lower, have retained the true idea, and the convictions
associated with it; but are afraid to speak it out, and equivocate
about it in public; this equivocation mainly proceeding from
their desire to connect another meaning with it, and a false one;&mdash;that
of &ldquo;a man living in idleness on other people&rsquo;s labor;&rdquo;&mdash;with
which idea, the term has nothing whatever to do.</p>

<p>The lower classes, denying vigorously, and with reason, the
notion that a gentleman means an idler, and rightly feeling that
the more any one works, the more of a gentleman he becomes,
and is likely to become,&mdash;have nevertheless got little of the good
they otherwise might, from the truth, because, with it, they
wanted to hold a falsehood,&mdash;namely, that race was of no consequence.
It being precisely of as much consequence in man as
it is in any other animal.</p>

<p>§ 2. The nation cannot truly prosper till both these errors
are finally got quit of. Gentlemen have to learn that it is no
part of their duty or privilege to live on other people&rsquo;s toil.
They have to learn that there is no degradation in the hardest
manual, or the humblest servile, labor, when it is honest. But
that there <i>is</i> degradation, and that deep, in extravagance, in
bribery, in indolence, in pride, in taking places they are not fit
for, or in coining places for which there is no need. It does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
disgrace a gentleman to become an errand boy, or a day laborer;
but it disgraces him much to become a knave, or a thief. And
knavery is not the less knavery because it involves large interests,
nor theft the less theft because it is countenanced by usage, or
accompanied by failure in undertaken duty. It is an incomparably
less guilty form of robbery to cut a purse out of a man&rsquo;s
pocket, than to take it out of his hand on the understanding
that you are to steer his ship up channel, when you do not know
the soundings.</p>

<p>§ 3. On the other hand, the lower orders, and all orders,
have to learn that every vicious habit and chronic disease communicates
itself by descent; and that by purity of birth the
entire system of the human body and soul may be gradually
elevated, or by recklessness of birth, degraded; until there shall
be as much difference between the well-bred and ill-bred human
creature (whatever pains be taken with their education) as between
a wolf-hound and the vilest mongrel cur. And the knowledge
of this great fact ought to regulate the education of our
youth, and the entire conduct of the nation.<a name="fa1y" id="fa1y" href="#ft1y"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>§ 4. Gentlemanliness, however, in ordinary parlance, must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
be taken to signify those qualities which are usually the evidence
of high breeding, and which, so far as they can be acquired, it
should be every man&rsquo;s effort to acquire; or, if he has them by
nature, to preserve and exalt. Vulgarity, on the other hand,
will signify qualities usually characteristic of ill-breeding, which,
according to his power, it becomes every person&rsquo;s duty to subdue.
We have briefly to note what these are.</p>

<p>§ 5. A gentleman&rsquo;s first characteristic is that fineness of
structure in the body, which renders it capable of the most delicate
sensation; and of structure in the mind which renders it
capable of the most delicate sympathies&mdash;one may say, simply,
&ldquo;fineness of nature.&rdquo; This is, of course, compatible with heroic
bodily strength and mental firmness; in fact, heroic strength is
not conceivable without such delicacy. Elephantine strength
may drive its way through a forest and feel no touch of the
boughs; but the white skin of Homer&rsquo;s Atrides would have felt
a bent rose-leaf, yet subdue its feeling in glow of battle, and behave
itself like iron. I do not mean to call an elephant a vulgar
animal; but if you think about him carefully, you will find that
his non-vulgarity consists in such gentleness as is possible to
elephantine nature; not in his insensitive hide, nor in his
clumsy foot; but in the way he will lift his foot if a child lies in
his way; and in his sensitive trunk, and still more sensitive
mind, and capability of pique on points of honor.</p>

<p>§ 6. And, though rightness of moral conduct is ultimately
the great purifier of race, the sign of nobleness is not in this
rightness of moral conduct, but in sensitiveness. When the
make of the creature is fine, its temptations are strong, as well
as its perceptions; it is liable to all kinds of impressions from
without in their most violent form; liable therefore to be abused
and hurt by all kinds of rough things which would do a coarser
creature little harm, and thus to fall into frightful wrong if its
fate will have it so. Thus David, coming of gentlest as well as
royalest race, of Ruth as well as of Judah, is sensitiveness
through all flesh and spirit; not that his compassion will restrain
him from murder when his terror urges him to it; nay,
he is driven to the murder all the more by his sensitiveness to
the shame which otherwise threatens him. But when his own
story is told him under a disguise, though only a lamb is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
concerned, his passion about it leaves him no time for thought.
&ldquo;The man shall die&rdquo;&mdash;note the reason&mdash;&ldquo;because he had no
pity.&rdquo; He is so eager and indignant that it never occurs to him
as strange that Nathan hides the name. This is true gentleman.
A vulgar man would assuredly have been cautious, and asked
&ldquo;who it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 7. Hence it will follow that one of the probable signs of
high-breeding in men generally, will be their kindness and
mercifulness; these always indicating more or less fineness of
make in the mind; and miserliness and cruelty the contrary;
hence that of Isaiah: &ldquo;The vile person shall no more be called
liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.&rdquo; But a thousand
things may prevent this kindness from displaying or continuing
itself; the mind of the man may be warped so as to bear
mainly on his own interests, and then all his sensibilities will
take the form of pride, or fastidiousness, or revengefulness; and
other wicked, but not ungentlemanly tempers; or, farther, they
may run into utter sensuality and covetousness, if he is bent on
pleasure, accompanied with quite infinite cruelty when the pride
is wounded, or the passions thwarted;&mdash;until your gentleman becomes
Ezzelin, and your lady, the deadly Lucrece; yet still gentleman
and lady, quite incapable of making anything else of
themselves, being so born.</p>

<p>§ 8. A truer sign of breeding than mere kindness is therefore
sympathy; a vulgar man may often be kind in a hard way,
on principle, and because he thinks he ought to be; whereas, a
highly-bred man, even when cruel, will be cruel in a softer way,
understanding and feeling what he inflicts, and pitying his victim.
Only we must carefully remember that the quantity of
sympathy a gentleman feels can never be judged of by its outward
expression, for another of his chief characteristics is apparent
reserve. I say &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; reserve; for the sympathy is real,
but the reserve not: a perfect gentleman is never reserved, but
sweetly and entirely open, so far as it is good for others, or
possible, that he should be. In a great many respects it is impossible
that he should be open except to men of his own kind.
To them, he can open himself, by a word, or syllable, or a glance;
but to men not of his kind he cannot open himself, though he
tried it through an eternity of clear grammatical speech. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
the very acuteness of his sympathy he knows how much of himself
he can give to anybody; and he gives that much frankly;&mdash;would
always be glad to give more if he could, but is obliged,
nevertheless, in his general intercourse with the world, to be a
somewhat silent person; silence is to most people, he finds, less
reserved than speech. Whatever he said, a vulgar man would
misinterpret: no words that he could use would bear the same
sense to the vulgar man that they do to him; if he used any, the
vulgar man would go away saying, &ldquo;He had said so and so, and
meant so and so&rdquo; (something assuredly he never meant); but
he keeps silence, and the vulgar man goes away saying, &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t know what to make of him.&rdquo; Which is precisely the fact,
and the only fact which he is anywise able to announce to the
vulgar man concerning himself.</p>

<p>§ 9. There is yet another quite as efficient cause of the apparent
reserve of a gentleman. His sensibility being constant
and intelligent, it will be seldom that a feeling touches him,
however acutely, but it has touched him in the same way often
before, and in some sort is touching him always. It is not that
he feels little, but that he feels habitually; a vulgar man having
some heart at the bottom of him, if you can by talk or by sight
fairly force the pathos of anything down to his heart, will be
excited about it and demonstrative; the sensation of pity being
strange to him, and wonderful. But your gentleman has walked
in pity all day long; the tears have never been out of his eyes:
you thought the eyes were bright only; but they were wet. You
tell him a sorrowful story, and his countenance does not change;
the eyes can but be wet still; he does not speak neither, there
being, in fact, nothing to be said, only something to be done;
some vulgar person, beside you both, goes away saying, &ldquo;How
hard he is!&rdquo; Next day he hears that the hard person has put
good end to the sorrow he said nothing about;&mdash;and then he
changes his wonder, and exclaims, &ldquo;How reserved he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 10. Self-command is often thought a characteristic of high-breeding:
and to a certain extent it is so, at least it is one of the
means of forming and strengthening character; but it is rather
a way of imitating a gentleman than a characteristic of him; a
true gentleman has no need of self-command; he simply feels
rightly on all occasions: and desiring to express only so much of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
his feeling as it is right to express, does not need to command
himself. Hence perfect ease is indeed characteristic of him;
but perfect ease is inconsistent with self-restraint. Nevertheless
gentlemen, so far as they fail of their own ideal, need to command
themselves, and do so; while, on the contrary, to feel unwisely,
and to be unable to restrain the expression of the unwise
feeling, is vulgarity; and yet even then, the vulgarity, at its
root, is not in the mistimed expression, but in the unseemly
feeling; and when we find fault with a vulgar person for &ldquo;exposing
himself,&rdquo; it is not his openness, but clumsiness; and yet
more the want of sensibility to his own failure, which we blame;
so that still the vulgarity resolves itself into want of sensibility.
Also, it is to be noted that great powers of self-restraint may be
attained by very vulgar persons, when it suits their purposes.</p>

<p>§ 11. Closely, but strangely, connected with this openness is
that form of truthfulness which is opposed to cunning, yet not
opposed to falsity absolute. And herein is a distinction of great
importance.</p>

<p>Cunning signifies especially a habit or gift of over-reaching,
accompanied with enjoyment and a sense of superiority. It is
associated with small and dull conceit, and with an absolute want
of sympathy or affection. Its essential connection with vulgarity
may be at once exemplified by the expression of the butcher&rsquo;s dog
in Landseer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Low Life.&rdquo; Cruikshank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Noah Claypole,&rdquo; in
the illustrations to Oliver Twist, in the interview with the Jew,
is, however, still more characteristic. It is the intensest rendering
of vulgarity absolute and utter with which I am acquainted.<a name="fa2y" id="fa2y" href="#ft2y"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>The truthfulness which is opposed to cunning ought, perhaps,
rather to be called the desire of truthfulness; it consists
more in unwillingness to deceive than in not deceiving,&mdash;an unwillingness
implying sympathy with and respect for the person
deceived; and a fond observance of truth up to the possible
point, as in a good soldier&rsquo;s mode of retaining his honor through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
a <i>ruse-de-guerre</i>. A cunning person seeks for opportunities to
deceive; a gentleman shuns them. A cunning person triumphs
in deceiving; a gentleman is humiliated by his success, or at
least by so much of the success as is dependent merely on the
falsehood, and not on his intellectual superiority.</p>

<p>§ 12. The absolute disdain of all lying belongs rather to
Christian chivalry than to mere high breeding; as connected
merely with this latter, and with general refinement and courage,
the exact relations of truthfulness may be best studied in the
well-trained Greek mind. The Greeks believed that mercy and
truth were co-relative virtues&mdash;cruelty and falsehood co-relative
vices. But they did not call necessary severity, cruelty; nor
necessary deception, falsehood. It was needful sometimes to
slay men, and sometimes to deceive them. When this had to be
done, it should be done well and thoroughly; so that to direct
a spear well to its mark, or a lie well to its end, was equally the
accomplishment of a perfect gentleman. Hence, in the pretty
diamond-cut-diamond scene between Pallas and Ulysses, when
she receives him on the coast of Ithaca, the goddess laughs
delightedly at her hero&rsquo;s good lying, and gives him her hand
upon it; showing herself then in her woman&rsquo;s form, as just a
little more than his match. &ldquo;Subtle would he be, and stealthy,
who should go beyond thee in deceit, even were he a god, thou
many-witted! What! here in thine own land, too, wilt thou
not cease from cheating? Knowest thou not me, Pallas Athena,
maid of Jove, who am with thee in all thy labors, and gave
thee favor with the Phæacians, and keep thee, and have come
now to weave cunning with thee?&rdquo; But how completely this
kind of cunning was looked upon as a part of a man&rsquo;s power,
and not as a diminution of faithfulness, is perhaps best shown by
the single line of praise in which the high qualities of his servant
are summed up by Chremulus in the Plutus&mdash;&ldquo;Of all my house
servants, I hold you to be the faithfullest, and the greatest cheat
(or thief).&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 13. Thus, the primal difference between honorable and base
lying in the Greek mind lay in honorable purpose. A man who
used his strength wantonly to hurt others was a monster; so,
also, a man who used his cunning wantonly to hurt others.
Strength and cunning were to be used only in self-defence, or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
save the weak, and then were alike admirable. This was their
first idea. Then the second, and perhaps the more essential,
difference between noble and ignoble lying in the Greek mind,
was that the honorable lie&mdash;or, if we may use the strange, yet
just, expression, the true lie&mdash;knew and confessed itself for such&mdash;was
ready to take the full responsibility of what it did. As
the sword answered for its blow, so the lie for its snare. But
what the Greeks hated with all their heart was the false lie; the lie
that did not know itself, feared to confess itself, which slunk to
its aim under a cloak of truth, and sought to do liars&rsquo; work, and
yet not take liars&rsquo; pay, excusing itself to the conscience by quibble
and quirk. Hence the great expression of Jesuit principle
by Euripides, &ldquo;The tongue has sworn, but not the heart,&rdquo; was
a subject of execration throughout Greece, and the satirists exhausted
their arrows on it&mdash;no audience was ever tired hearing
(<span class="grk" title="to Euripideion ekeino">&#964;&#8056; &#917;&#8020;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#959;</span>) &ldquo;that Euripidean thing&rdquo; brought to
shame.</p>

<p>§ 14. And this is especially to be insisted on in the early education
of young people. It should be pointed out to them with
continual earnestness that the essence of lying is in deception,
not in words; a lie may be told by silence, by equivocation, by
the accent on a syllable, by a glance of the eye attaching a peculiar
significance to a sentence; and all these kinds of lies are
worse and baser by many degrees than a lie plainly worded; so
that no form of blinded conscience is so far sunk as that which
comforts itself for having deceived, because the deception was by
gesture or silence, instead of utterance; and, finally, according
to Tennyson&rsquo;s deep and trenchant line, &ldquo;A lie which is half a
truth is ever the worst of lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 15. Although, however, ungenerous cunning is usually so
distinct an outward manifestation of vulgarity, that I name it
separately from insensibility, it is in truth only an effect of insensibility,
producing want of affection to others, and blindness
to the beauty of truth. The degree in which political subtlety
in men such as Richelieu, Machiavel, or Metternich, will efface
the gentleman, depends on the selfishness of political purpose to
which the cunning is directed, and on the base delight taken in
its use. The command, &ldquo;Be ye wise as serpents, harmless as
doves,&rdquo; is the ultimate expression of this principle, misunderstood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
usually because the word &ldquo;wise&rdquo; is referred to the intellectual
power instead of the subtlety of the serpent. The serpent
has very little intellectual power, but according to that
which it has, it is yet, as of old, the subtlest of the beasts of the
field.</p>

<p>§ 16. Another great sign of vulgarity is also, when traced to
its root, another phase of insensibility, namely, the undue regard
to appearances and manners, as in the households of vulgar persons,
of all stations, and the assumption of behavior, language,
or dress unsuited to them, by persons in inferior stations of life.
I say &ldquo;undue&rdquo; regard to appearances, because in the undueness
consists, of course, the vulgarity. It is due and wise in some
sort to care for appearances, in another sort undue and unwise.
Wherein lies the difference?</p>

<p>At first one is apt to answer quickly: the vulgarity is simply
in pretending to be what you are not. But that answer will not
stand. A queen may dress like a waiting maid,&mdash;perhaps succeed,
if she chooses, in passing for one; but she will not, therefore,
be vulgar; nay, a waiting maid may dress like a queen, and
pretend to be one, and yet need not be vulgar, unless there is inherent
vulgarity in her. In Scribe&rsquo;s very absurd but very amusing
<i>Reine d&rsquo;un jour</i>, a milliner&rsquo;s girl sustains the part of a queen
for a day. She several times amazes and disgusts her courtiers
by her straightforwardness; and once or twice very nearly betrays
herself to her maids of honor by an unqueenly knowledge of sewing;
but she is not in the least vulgar, for she is sensitive, simple,
and generous, and a queen could be no more.</p>

<p>§ 17. Is the vulgarity, then, only in trying to play a part you
cannot play, so as to be continually detected? No; a bad amateur
actor may be continually detected in his part, but yet continually
detected to be a gentleman: a vulgar regard to appearances
has nothing in it necessarily of hypocrisy. You shall know
a man not to be a gentleman by the perfect and neat pronunciation
of his words: but he does not pretend to pronounce accurately;
he <i>does</i> pronounce accurately, the vulgarity is in the real
(not assumed) scrupulousness.</p>

<p>§ 18. It will be found on farther thought, that a vulgar regard
for appearances is, primarily, a selfish one, resulting, not out of a
wish, to give pleasure (as a wife&rsquo;s wish to make herself beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
for her husband), but out of an endeavor to mortify others, or
attract for pride&rsquo;s sake;&mdash;the common &ldquo;keeping up appearances&rdquo;
of society, being a mere selfish struggle of the vain with the vain.
But the deepest stain of the vulgarity depends on this being
done, not selfishly only, but stupidly, without understanding the
impression which is really produced, nor the relations of importance
between oneself and others, so as to suppose that their attention
is fixed upon us, when we are in reality ciphers in their
eyes&mdash;all which comes of insensibility. Hence pride simple is
not vulgar (the looking down on others because of their true inferiority
to us), nor vanity simple (the desire of praise), but conceit
simple (the attribution to ourselves of qualities we have not),
is always so. In cases of over-studied pronunciation, &amp;c., there
is insensibility, first, in the person&rsquo;s thinking more of himself
than of what he is saying; and, secondly, in his not having
musical fineness of ear enough to feel that his talking is uneasy
and strained.</p>

<p>§ 19. Finally, vulgarity is indicated by coarseness of language
or manners, only so far as this coarseness has been contracted
under circumstances not necessarily producing it. The illiterateness
of a Spanish or Calabrian peasant is not vulgar, because they
had never an opportunity of acquiring letters; but the illiterateness
of an English school-boy is. So again, provincial dialect is
not vulgar; but cockney dialect, the corruption, by blunted
sense, of a finer language continually heard, is so in a deep degree;
and again, of this corrupted dialect, that is the worst
which consists, not in the direct or expressive alteration of the
form of a word, but in an unmusical destruction of it by dead
utterance and bad or swollen formation of lip. There is no vulgarity
in&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">but much in Mrs. Gamp&rsquo;s inarticulate &ldquo;bottle on the chumley-piece,
and let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 20. So also of personal defects, those only are vulgar which
imply insensibility or dissipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span></p>

<p>There is no vulgarity in the emaciation of Don Quixote, the
deformity of the Black Dwarf, or the corpulence of Falstaff; but
much in the same personal characters, as they are seen in Uriah
Heep, Quilp, and Chadband.</p>

<p>§ 21. One of the most curious minor questions in this matter
is respecting the vulgarity of excessive neatness, complicating
itself with inquiries into the distinction between base neatness,
and the perfectness of good execution in the fine arts. It will be
found on final thought that precision and exquisiteness of arrangement
are always noble; but become vulgar only when they
arise from an equality (insensibility) of temperament, which is
incapable of fine passion, and is set ignobly, and with a dullard
mechanism, on accuracy in vile things. In the finest Greek
coins, the letters of the inscriptions are purposely coarse and
rude, while the relievi are wrought with inestimable care. But
in an English coin, the letters are the best done, and the whole
is unredeemably vulgar. In a picture of Titian&rsquo;s, an inserted
inscription will be complete in the lettering, as all the rest is;
because it costs Titian very little more trouble to draw rightly
than wrongly, and in him, therefore, impatience with the letters
would be vulgar, as in the Greek sculptor of the coin, patience
would have been. For the engraving of a letter accurately<a name="fa3y" id="fa3y" href="#ft3y"><span class="sp">3</span></a> is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
difficult work, and his time must have been unworthily thrown
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span></p>

<p>§ 22. All the different impressions connected with negligence
or foulness depend, in like manner, on the degree of insensibility
implied. Disorder in a drawing-room is vulgar, in an
antiquary&rsquo;s study, not; the black battle-stain on a soldier&rsquo;s face
is not vulgar, but the dirty face of a housemaid is.</p>

<p>And lastly, courage, so far as it is a sign of race, is peculiarly
the mark of a gentleman or a lady: but it becomes vulgar if rude
or insensitive, while timidity is not vulgar, if it be a characteristic
of race or fineness of make. A fawn is not vulgar in being
timid, nor a crocodile &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; because courageous.</p>

<p>§ 23. Without following the inquiry into farther detail,<a name="fa4y" id="fa4y" href="#ft4y"><span class="sp">4</span></a> we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
may conclude that vulgarity consists in a deadness of the heart
and body, resulting from prolonged, and especially from inherited
conditions of &ldquo;degeneracy,&rdquo; or literally &ldquo;un-racing;&rdquo;&mdash;gentlemanliness,
being another word for an intense humanity.
And vulgarity shows itself primarily in dulness of heart, not in
rage or cruelty, but in inability to feel or conceive noble character
or emotion. This is its essential, pure, and most fatal form.
Dulness of bodily sense and general stupidity, with such forms of
crime as peculiarly issue from stupidity, are its material manifestation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span></p>

<p>§ 24. Two years ago, when I was first beginning to work out
the subject, and chatting with one of my keenest-minded friends
(Mr. Brett, the painter of the Val d&rsquo;Aosta in the Exhibition of
1859), I casually asked him, &ldquo;What is vulgarity?&rdquo; merely to see
what he would say, not supposing it possible to get a sudden answer.
He thought for about a minute, then answered quietly,
&ldquo;It is merely one of the forms of Death.&rdquo; I did not see the
meaning of the reply at the time; but on testing it, found that
it met every phase of the difficulties connected with the inquiry,
and summed the true conclusion. Yet, in order to be complete,
it ought to be made a distinctive as well as conclusive definition;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
showing <i>what</i> form of death vulgarity is; for death itself is not
vulgar, but only death mingled with life. I cannot, however,
construct a short-worded definition which will include all the
minor conditions of bodily degeneracy; but the term &ldquo;deathful
selfishness&rdquo; will embrace all the most fatal and essential forms of
mental vulgarity.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1y" id="ft1y" href="#fa1y"><span class="fn">1</span></a> We ought always in pure English to use the term &ldquo;good breeding&rdquo;
literally; and to say &ldquo;good nurture&rdquo; for what we usually mean by good
breeding. Given the race and make of the animal, you may turn it to good
or bad account; you may spoil your good dog or colt, and make him as
vicious as you choose, or break his back at once by ill-usage; and you may,
on the other hand, make something serviceable and respectable out of your
poor cur or colt if you educate them carefully; but ill bred they will both
of them be to their lives&rsquo; end; and the best you will ever be able to say of
them is, that they are useful, and decently behaved ill-bred creatures. An
error, which is associated with the truth, and which makes it always look
weak and disputable, is the confusion of race with name; and the supposition
that the blood of a family must still be good, if its genealogy be unbroken
and its name not lost, though sire and son have been indulging age
after age in habits involving perpetual degeneracy of race. Of course it is
equally an error to suppose that, because a man&rsquo;s name is common, his
blood must be base; since his family may have been ennobling it by pureness
of moral habit for many generations, and yet may not have got any
title, or other sign of nobleness attached to their names. Nevertheless, the
probability is always in favor of the race which has had acknowledged
supremacy, and in which every motive leads to the endeavor to preserve
their true nobility.</p>

<p><a name="ft2y" id="ft2y" href="#fa2y"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Among the reckless losses of the right service of intellectual power
with which this century must be charged, very few are, to my mind, more
to be regretted than that which is involved in its having turned to no higher
purpose than the illustration of the career of Jack Sheppard, and of the
Irish Rebellion, the great, grave (I use the words deliberately and with large
meaning), and singular genius of Cruikshank.</p>

<p><a name="ft3y" id="ft3y" href="#fa3y"><span class="fn">3</span></a> There is this farther reason also: &ldquo;Letters are always ugly things&rdquo;&mdash;(Seven
Lamps, chap. iv. s. 9). Titian often wanted a certain quantity of
ugliness to oppose his beauty with, as a certain quantity of black to oppose
his color. He could regulate the size and quantity of inscription as he
liked; and, therefore, made it as neat&mdash;that is, as effectively ugly&mdash;as possible.
But the Greek sculptor could not regulate either size or quantity of
inscription. Legible it must be, to common eyes, and contain an assigned
group of words. He had more ugliness than he wanted, or could endure.
There was nothing for it but to make the letters themselves rugged and
picturesque; to give them&mdash;that is, a certain quantity of organic variety.</p>

<p>I do not wonder at people sometimes thinking I contradict myself when
they come suddenly on any of the scattered passages, in which I am forced
to insist on the opposite practical applications of subtle principles of this
kind. It may amuse the reader, and be finally serviceable to him in showing
him how necessary it is to the right handling of any subject, that these
contrary statements should be made, if I assemble here the principal ones I
remember having brought forward, bearing on this difficult point of precision
in execution.</p>

<p>It would be well if you would first glance over the chapter on Finish in
the third volume; and if, coming to the fourth paragraph, about gentlemen&rsquo;s
carriages, you have time to turn to Sydney Smith&rsquo;s Memoirs and read
his account of the construction of the &ldquo;Immortal,&rdquo; it will furnish you with
an interesting illustration.</p>

<p>The general conclusion reached in that chapter being that finish, for the
sake of added truth, or utility, or beauty, is noble; but finish, for the sake
of workmanship, neatness, or polish, ignoble,&mdash;turn to the fourth chapter of
the Seven Lamps, where you will find the Campanile of Giotto given as
the model and mirror of perfect architecture, just on account of its exquisite
completion. Also, in the next chapter, I expressly limit the delightfulness
of rough and imperfect work to developing and unformed schools (pp.
142-3, 1st edition); then turn to the 170th page of the Stones of Venice,
Vol. III., and you will find this directly contrary statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No good work whatever can be perfect, and the demand for perfection
is always a sign of the misunderstanding of the end of art.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;The
first cause of the fall of the arts in Europe was a relentless requirement of
perfection&rdquo; (p. 172). By reading the intermediate text, you will be put in
possession of many good reasons for this opinion; and, comparing it with
that just cited about the Campanile of Giotto, will be brought, I hope, into
a wholesome state of not knowing what to think.</p>

<p>Then turn to p. 167, where the great law of finish is again maintained as
strongly as ever: &ldquo;Perfect finish (finish, that is to say, up to the point possible)
is always desirable from the greatest masters, and is always given by
them.&rdquo;&mdash;§ 19.</p>

<p>And, lastly, if you look to § 19 of the chapter on the Early Renaissance,
you will find the profoundest respect paid to completion; and, at the close
of that chapter, § 38, the principle is resumed very strongly. &ldquo;As <i>ideals of
executive perfection</i>, these palaces are most notable among the architecture of
Europe, and the Rio façade of the Ducal palace, as an example of finished
masonry in a vast building, is one of the finest things, not only in Venice,
but in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now all these passages are perfectly true; and, as in much more serious
matters, the essential thing for the reader is to receive their truth, however
little he may be able to see their consistency. If truths of apparent contrary
character are candidly and rightly received, they will fit themselves
together in the mind without any trouble. But no truth maliciously received
will nourish you, or fit with others. The clue of connection may in
this case, however, be given in a word. Absolute finish is always right;
finish, inconsistent with prudence and passion, wrong. The imperative demand
for finish is ruinous, because it refuses better things than finish. The
stopping short of the finish, which is honorably possible to human energy,
is destructive on the other side, and not in less degree. Err, of the two, on
the side of completion.</p>

<p><a name="ft4y" id="ft4y" href="#fa4y"><span class="fn">4</span></a> In general illustration of the subject, the following extract from my
private diary possesses some interest. It refers to two portraits which happened
to be placed opposite to each other in the arrangement of a gallery;
one, modern, of a (foreign) general on horseback at a review; the other, by
Vandyck, also an equestrian portrait, of an ancestor of his family, whom I
shall here simply call the &ldquo;knight:&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seldom seen so noble a Vandyck, chiefly because it is painted
with less flightiness and flimsiness than usual, with a grand quietness and
reserve&mdash;almost like Titian. The other is, on the contrary, as vulgar and
base a picture as I have ever seen, and it becomes a matter of extreme interest
to trace the cause of the difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, everything the general and his horse wear is evidently
just made. It has not only been cleaned that morning, but has been
sent home from the tailor&rsquo;s in a hurry last night. Horse bridle, saddle
housings, blue coat, stars and lace thereupon, cocked hat, and sword hilt&mdash;all
look as if they had just been taken from a shopboard in Pall Mall; the
irresistible sense of the coat having been brushed to perfection is the first
sentiment which the picture summons. The horse has also been rubbed
down all the morning, and shines from head to tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The knight rides in a suit of rusty armor. It has evidently been polished
also carefully, and gleams brightly here and there; but all the polishing
in the world will never take the battle-dints and battle-darkness out of
it. His horse is gray, not lustrous, but a dark, lurid gray. Its mane is deep
and soft: part of it shaken in front over its forehead&mdash;the rest, in enormous
masses of waving gold, six feet long, falls streaming on its neck, and rises
in currents of softest light, rippled by the wind, over the rider&rsquo;s armor. The
saddle cloth is of a dim red, fading into leathern brown, gleaming with
sparkles of obscure gold. When, after looking a little while at the soft
mane of the Vandyck horse, we turn back to the general&rsquo;s, we are shocked
by the evident coarseness of its hair, which hangs, indeed, in long locks
over the bridle, but is stiff, crude, sharp pointed, coarsely colored (a kind of
buff); no fine drawing of nostril or neck can give any look of nobleness to
the animal which carries such hair; it looks like a hobby-horse with tow
glued to it, which riotous children have half pulled out or scratched out.
The next point of difference is the isolation of Vandyck&rsquo;s figure, compared
with the modern painter&rsquo;s endeavor to ennoble his by subduing others. The
knight seems to be just going out of his castle gates; his horse rears as he
passes their pillars; there is nothing behind but the sky. But the general
is reviewing a regiment; the ensign lowers its colors to him; he takes off
his hat in return. All which reviewing and bowing is in its very nature
ignoble, wholly unfit to be painted: a gentleman might as well be painted
leaving his card on somebody. And, in the next place, the modern painter
has thought to enhance his officer by putting the regiment some distance
back, and in the shade, so that the men look only about five feet high, being
besides very ill painted to keep them in better subordination. One does not
know whether most to despise the feebleness of the painter who must have
recourse to such an artifice, or his vulgarity in being satisfied with it. I
ought, by the way, before leaving the point of dress, to have noted that the
vulgarity of the painter is considerably assisted by the vulgarity of the costume
itself. Not only is it base in being new, but base in that it cannot last
to be old. If one wanted a lesson on the ugliness of modern costume, it
could not be more sharply received than by turning from one to the other
horseman. The knight wears steel plate armor, chased here and there
with gold; the delicate, rich, pointed lace collar falling on the embossed
breastplate; his dark hair flowing over his shoulders; a crimson silk scarf
fastened round his waist, and floating behind him; buff boots, deep folded
at the instep, set in silver stirrup. The general wears his hair cropped
short; blue coat, padded and buttoned; blue trowsers and red stripe;
black shiny boots; common saddler&rsquo;s stirrups; cocked hat in hand, suggestive
of absurd completion, when assumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing noticeable as giving nobleness to the Vandyck is its
feminineness: the rich, light silken scarf, the flowing hair, the delicate,
sharp, though sunburnt features, and the lace collar, do not in the least
diminish the manliness, but <i>add</i> feminineness. One sees that the knight is
indeed a soldier, but not a soldier only; that he is accomplished in all
ways, and tender in all thoughts: while the general is represented as
nothing but a soldier&mdash;and it is very doubtful if he is even that&mdash;one is
sure, at a glance, that if he can do anything but put his hat off and on, and
give words of command, the anything must, at all events, have something
to do with the barracks; that there is no grace, nor music, nor softness,
nor learnedness, in the man&rsquo;s soul; that he is made up of forms and accoutrements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lastly, the modern picture is as bad painting as it is wretched conceiving,
and one is struck, in looking from it to Vandyck&rsquo;s, peculiarly by the fact
that good work is always <i>enjoyed</i> work. There is not a touch of Vandyck&rsquo;s
pencil but he seems to have revelled in&mdash;not grossly, but delicately&mdash;tasting
the color in every touch as an epicure would wine. While the other goes on
daub, daub, daub, like a bricklayer spreading mortar&mdash;nay, with far less
lightness of hand or lightness of spirit than a good bricklayer&rsquo;s&mdash;covering
his canvas heavily and conceitedly at once, caring only but to catch the
public eye with his coarse, presumptuous, ponderous, illiterate work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus far my diary. In case it should be discovered by any one where
these pictures are, it should be noted that the vulgarity of the modern one is
wholly the painter&rsquo;s fault. It implies none in the general (except bad taste
in pictures). The same painter would have made an equally vulgar portrait
of Bayard. And as for taste in pictures, the general&rsquo;s was not singular. I
used to spend much time before the Vandyck; and among all the tourist
visitors to the gallery, who were numerous, I never saw one look at it
twice, but all paused in respectful admiration before the padded surtout.
The reader will find, farther, many interesting and most valuable notes on
the subject of nobleness and vulgarity in Emerson&rsquo;s Essays, and every phase
of nobleness illustrated in Sir Kenelm Digby&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broad Stone of Honor.&rdquo;
The best help I have ever had&mdash;so far as help depended on the sympathy or
praise of others in work which, year after year, it was necessary to pursue
through the abuse of the brutal and the base&mdash;was given me, when this author,
from whom I had first learned to love nobleness, introduced frequent
reference to my own writings in his &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Bower.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="center chap2">WOUVERMANS AND ANGELICO.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Having</span> determined the general nature of vulgarity, we
are now able to close our view of the character of the Dutch
school.</p>

<p>It is a strangely mingled one, which I have the more difficulty
in investigating, because I have no power of sympathy with
it. However inferior in capacity, I can enter measuredly into
the feelings of Correggio or of Titian; what they like, I like;
what they disdain, I disdain. Going lower down, I can still follow
Salvator&rsquo;s passion, or Albano&rsquo;s prettiness; and lower still, I
can measure modern German heroics, or French sensualities. I
see what the people mean,&mdash;know where they are, and what they
are. But no effort of fancy will enable me to lay hold of the
temper of Teniers or Wouvermans, any more than I can enter
into the feelings of one of the lower animals. I cannot see why
they painted,&mdash;what they are aiming at,&mdash;what they liked or
disliked. All their life and work is the same sort of mystery to
me as the mind of my dog when he rolls on carrion. He is a
well enough conducted dog in other respects, and many of these
Dutchmen were doubtless very well-conducted persons: certainly
they learned their business well; both Teniers and Wouvermans
touch with a workmanly hand, such as we cannot see rivalled
now; and they seem never to have painted indolently, but gave
the purchaser his thorough money&rsquo;s worth of mechanism, while
the burgesses who bargained for their cattle and card parties
were probably more respectable men than the princes who gave
orders to Titian for nymphs, and to Raphael for nativities. But
whatever patient merit or commercial value may be in Dutch
labor, this at least is clear, that it is wholly insensitive.</p>

<p>The very mastery these men have of their business proceeds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
from their never really seeing the whole of anything, but only
that part of it which they know how to do. Out of all nature
they felt their function was to extract the grayness and shininess.
Give them a golden sunset, a rosy dawn, a green waterfall, a
scarlet autumn on the hills, and they merely look curiously into
it to see if there is anything gray and glittering which can be
painted on their common principles.</p>

<p>§ 2. If this, however, were their only fault, it would not
prove absolute insensibility, any more than it could be declared
of the makers of Florentine tables, that they were blind or vulgar
because they took out of nature only what could be represented
in agate. A Dutch picture is, in fact, merely a Florentine
table more finely touched: it has its regular ground of slate,
and its mother-of-pearl and tinsel put in with equal precision;
and perhaps the fairest view one can take of a Dutch painter is,
that he is a respectable tradesman furnishing well-made articles
in oil paint: but when we begin to examine the designs of these
articles, we may see immediately that it is his inbred vulgarity,
and not the chance of fortune, which has made him a tradesman,
and kept him one;&mdash;which essential character of Dutch
work, as distinguished from all other, may be best seen in that
hybrid landscape, introduced by Wouvermans and Berghem.
Of this landscape Wouvermans&rsquo; is the most characteristic. It will
be remembered that I called it &ldquo;hybrid,&rdquo; because it strove to
unite the attractiveness of every other school. We will examine
the motives of one of the most elaborate Wouvermans existing&mdash;the
landscape with a hunting party, No. 208 in the Pinacothek
of Munich.</p>

<p>§ 3. A large lake in the distance narrows into a river in the
foreground; but the river has no current, nor has the lake
either reflections or waves. It is a piece of gray slate-table,
painted with horizontal touches, and only explained to be water
by boats upon it. Some of the figures in these are fishing (the
corks of a net are drawn in bad perspective); others are bathing,
one man pulling his shirt over his ears, others are swimming.
On the farther side of the river are some curious buildings, half
villa, half ruin; or rather ruin dressed. There are gardens at
the top of them, with beautiful and graceful trellised architecture
and wandering tendrils of vine. A gentleman is coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
down from a door in the ruins to get into his pleasure-boat. His
servant catches his dog.</p>

<p>§ 4. On the nearer side of the river, a bank of broken ground
rises from the water&rsquo;s edge up to a group of very graceful and
carefully studied trees, with a French-antique statue on a pedestal
in the midst of them, at the foot of which are three musicians,
and a well-dressed couple dancing; their coach is in waiting
behind. In the foreground are hunters. A richly and
highly-dressed woman, with falcon on fist, the principal figure
in the picture, is wrought with Wouvermans&rsquo; best skill. A stouter
lady rides into the water after a stag and hind, who gallop across
the middle of the river without sinking. Two horsemen attend
the two Amazons, of whom one pursues the game cautiously,
but the other is thrown headforemost into the river, with a
splash which shows it to be deep at the edge, though the hart
and hind find bottom in the middle. Running footmen, with
other dogs, are coming up, and children are sailing a toy-boat
in the immediate foreground. The tone of the whole is dark and
gray, throwing out the figures in spots of light, on Wouvermans&rsquo;
usual system. The sky is cloudy, and very cold.</p>

<p>§ 5. You observe that in this picture the painter has assembled
all the elements which he supposes pleasurable. We have
music, dancing, hunting, boating, fishing, bathing, and child-play,
all at once. Water, wide and narrow; architecture, rustic
and classical; trees also of the finest; clouds, not ill-shaped.
Nothing wanting to our Paradise: not even practical jest; for
to keep us always laughing, somebody shall be for ever falling
with a splash into the Kishon. Things proceed, nevertheless,
with an oppressive quietude. The dancers are uninterested in
the hunters, the hunters in the dancers; the hirer of the pleasure-boat
perceives neither hart nor hind; the children are unconcerned
at the hunter&rsquo;s fall; the bathers regard not the draught
of fishes; the fishers fish among the bathers, without apparently
anticipating any diminution in their haul.</p>

<p>§ 6. Let the reader ask himself, would it have been possible
for the painter in any clearer way to show an absolute, clay-cold,
ice-cold incapacity of understanding what a pleasure meant?
Had he had as much heart as a minnow, he would have given
some interest to the fishing; with the soul of a grasshopper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
some spring to the dancing; had he half the will of a dog, he
would have made some one turn to look at the hunt, or given a
little fire to the dash down to the water&rsquo;s edge. If he had been
capable of pensiveness, he would not have put the pleasure-boat
under the ruin;&mdash;capable of cheerfulness, he would not have put
the ruin above the pleasure-boat. Paralyzed in heart and brain,
he delivers his inventoried articles of pleasure one by one to his
ravenous customers; palateless; gluttonous. &ldquo;We cannot taste
it. Hunting is not enough; let us have dancing. That&rsquo;s dull;
now give us a jest, or what is life! The river is too narrow, let
us have a lake; and, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, a pleasure-boat, or how
can we spend another minute of this languid day! But what
pleasure can be in a boat? let us swim; we see people always
drest, let us see them naked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 7. Such is the unredeemed, carnal appetite for mere sensual
pleasure. I am aware of no other painter who consults it
so exclusively, without one gleam of higher hope, thought, beauty,
or passion.</p>

<p>As the pleasure of Wouvermans, so also is his war. That,
however, is not hybrid, it is of one character only.</p>

<p>The best example I know is the great battle-piece with the
bridge, in the gallery of Turin. It is said that when this picture,
which had been taken to Paris, was sent back, the French offered
twelve thousand pounds (300,000 francs) for permission to keep
it. The report, true or not, shows the estimation in which the
picture is held at Turin.</p>

<p>§ 8. There are some twenty figures in the mêlée whose faces
can be seen (about sixty in the picture altogether), and of these
twenty, there is not one whose face indicates courage or power;
or anything but animal rage and cowardice; the latter prevailing
always. Every one is fighting for his life, with the expression of
a burglar defending himself at extremity against a party of policemen.
There is the same terror, fury, and pain which a low thief
would show on receiving a pistol-shot through his arm. Most
of them appear to be fighting only to get away; the standard-bearer
<i>is</i> retreating, but whether with the enemies&rsquo; flag or his
own I do not see; he slinks away with it, with reverted eye, as if
he were stealing a pocket-handkerchief. The swordsmen cut at
each other with clenched teeth and terrified eyes; they are too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
busy to curse each other; but one sees that the feelings they
have could be expressed no otherwise than by low oaths. Far
away, to the smallest figures in the smoke, and to one drowning
under the distant arch of the bridge, all are wrought with a consummate
skill in vulgar touch; there is no good painting, properly
so called, anywhere, but of clever, dotty, sparkling, telling
execution, as much as the canvas will hold, and much delicate
gray and blue color in the smoke and sky.</p>

<p>§ 9. Now, in order fully to feel the difference between this
view of war, and a gentleman&rsquo;s, go, if possible, into our National
Gallery, and look at the young Malatesta riding into the battle of
Sant&rsquo; Egidio (as he is painted by Paul Ucello). His uncle Carlo,
the leader of the army, a grave man of about sixty, has just given
orders for the knights to close: two have pushed forward with
lowered lances, and the mêlée has begun only a few yards in
front; but the young knight, riding at his uncle&rsquo;s side, has not
yet put his helmet on, nor intends doing so, yet. Erect he sits,
and quiet, waiting for his captain&rsquo;s orders to charge; calm as if
he were at a hawking party, only more grave; his golden hair
wreathed about his proud white brow, as about a statue&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>§ 10. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the thoughtful reader replies; &ldquo;this may be
pictorially very beautiful; but those Dutchmen were good fighters,
and generally won the day; whereas, this very battle of Sant&rsquo;
Egidio, so calmly and bravely begun, was lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, it is very singular that unmitigated expressions of
cowardice in battle should be given by the painters of so brave a
nation as the Dutch. Not but that it is possible enough for a
coward to be stubborn, and a brave man weak; the one may win
his battle by a blind persistence, and the other lose it by a
thoughtful vacillation. Nevertheless, the want of all expression
of resoluteness in Dutch battle-pieces remains, for the present, a
mystery to me. In those of Wouvermans, it is only a natural development
of his perfect vulgarity in all respects.</p>

<p>§ 11. I do not think it necessary to trace farther the evidences
of insensitive conception in the Dutch school. I have associated
the name of Teniers with that of Wouvermans in the beginning
of this chapter, because Teniers is essentially the painter of the
pleasures of the ale-house and card-table, as Wouvermans of those
of the chase; and the two are leading masters of the peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
Dutch trick of white touch on gray or brown ground; but
Teniers is higher in reach, and more honest in manner. Berghem
is the real associate of Wouvermans in the hybrid school of
landscape. But all three are alike insensitive; that is to say,
unspiritual or deathful, and that to the uttermost, in every
thought,&mdash;producing, therefore, the lowest phase of possible art
of a skilful kind. There are deeper elements in De Hooghe and
Gerard Terburg; sometimes expressed with superb quiet painting
by the former; but the whole school is inherently mortal to all
its admirers; having by its influence in England destroyed our
perception of all purposes of painting, and throughout the north
of the Continent effaced the sense of color among artists of every
rank.</p>

<p>We have, last, to consider what recovery has taken place
from the paralysis to which the influence of this Dutch art had
reduced us in England seventy years ago. But, in closing my
review of older art, I will endeavor to illustrate, by four simple
examples, the main directions of its spiritual power, and the
cause of its decline.</p>

<p>§ 12. The frontispiece of this volume is engraved from an
old sketch of mine, a pencil outline of the little Madonna by
Angelico, in the Annunciation preserved in the sacristy of Santa
Maria Novella. This Madonna has not, so far as I know, been
engraved before, and it is one of the most characteristic of the
Purist school. I believe through all my late work I have sufficiently
guarded my readers from over-estimating this school;
but it is well to turn back to it now, from the wholly carnal work
of Wouvermans, in order to feel its purity: so that, if we err, it
may be on this side. The opposition is the most accurate which
I can set before the student, for the technical disposition of
Wouvermans, in his search after delicate form and minute grace,
much resembles that of Angelico. But the thoughts of Wouvermans
are wholly of this world. For him there is no heroism, awe,
or mercy, hope, or faith. Eating and drinking, and slaying;
rage and lust; the pleasures and distresses of the debased body&mdash;from
these, his thoughts, if so we may call them, never for an
instant rise or range.</p>

<p>§ 13. The soul of Angelico is in all ways the precise reverse
of this; habitually as incognizant of any earthly pleasure as Wouvermans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
of any heavenly one. Both are exclusive with absolute
exclusiveness;&mdash;neither desiring nor conceiving anything beyond
their respective spheres. Wouvermans lives under gray clouds,
his lights come out as spots. Angelico lives in an unclouded
light: his shadows themselves are color; his lights are not the
spots, but his darks. Wouvermans lives in perpetual tumult&mdash;tramp
of horse&mdash;clash of cup&mdash;ring of pistol-shot. Angelico in
perpetual peace. Not seclusion from the world. No shutting
out of the world is needful for him. There is nothing to shut
out. Envy, lust, contention, discourtesy, are to him as though
they were not; and the cloister walk of Fiesole no penitential
solitude, barred from the stir and joy of life, but a possessed
land of tender blessing, guarded from the entrance of all but
holiest sorrow. The little cell was as one of the houses of
heaven prepared for him by his master. &ldquo;What need had it to
be elsewhere? Was not the Val d&rsquo;Arno, with its olive woods
in white blossom, paradise enough for a poor monk? or could
Christ be indeed in heaven more than here? Was he not always
with him? Could he breathe or see, but that Christ breathed
beside him and looked into his eyes? Under every cypress
avenue the angels walked; he had seen their white robes, whiter
than the dawn, at his bedside, as he awoke in early summer.
They had sung with him, one on each side, when his voice failed
for joy at sweet vesper and matin time; his eyes were blinded
by their wings in the sunset, when it sank behind the hills of
Luni.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There may be weakness in this, but there is no baseness; and
while I rejoice in all recovery from monasticism which leads to
practical and healthy action in the world, I must, in closing
this work, severely guard my pupils from the thought that
sacred rest may be honorably exchanged for selfish and mindless
activity.</p>

<p>§ 14. In order to mark the temper of Angelico, by a contrast
of another kind, I give, in Fig. 99, a facsimile of one of
the heads in Salvator&rsquo;s etching of the Academy of Plato. It is
accurately characteristic of Salvator, showing, by quite a central
type, his indignant, desolate, and degraded power. I could have
taken unspeakably baser examples from others of his etchings,
but they would have polluted my book, and been in some sort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
unjust, representing only the worst part of his work. This head,
which is as elevated a type as he ever reaches, is assuredly debased
enough; and a sufficient image of the mind of the painter of
Catiline and the Witch of Endor.</p>

<p>§ 15. Then, in Fig. 100, you have
also a central type of the mind of Durer.
Complete, yet quaint; severely rational
and practical, yet capable of the highest
imaginative religious feeling, and as
gentle as a child&rsquo;s, it seemed to be well
represented by this figure of the old
bishop, with all the infirmities, and all
the victory, of his life, written on his
calm, kind, and worldly face. He has
been no dreamer, nor persecutor, but a
helpful and undeceivable man; and by
careful comparison of this conception with the common kinds
of episcopal ideal in modern religious art, you will gradually
feel how the force of Durer is joined with an unapproachable
refinement, so that he can give the most practical view of whatever
he treats, without the slightest taint or shadow of vulgarity.
Lastly, the fresco of Giorgione, Plate 79, which is as
fair a type as I am able to give in any single figure, of the
central Venetian art, will complete for us a series, sufficiently
symbolical, of the several ranks of art, from lowest to highest.<a name="fa1z" id="fa1z" href="#ft1z"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
In Wouvermans (of whose work I suppose no example is needed,
it being so generally known), we have the entirely carnal mind,&mdash;wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
versed in the material world, and incapable of conceiving
any goodness or greatness whatsoever.</p>

<p>In Angelico, you have the entirely spiritual mind, wholly
versed in the heavenly world, and incapable of conceiving any
wickedness or vileness whatsoever.</p>

<p>In Salvator, you have an awakened conscience, and some
spiritual power, contending with evil, but conquered by it, and
brought into captivity to it.</p>

<p>In Durer, you have a far purer conscience and higher spiritual
power, yet, with some defect still in intellect, contending
with evil, and nobly prevailing over it; yet retaining the marks
of the contest, and never so entirely victorious as to conquer
sadness.</p>

<p>In Giorgione, you have the same high spiritual power and
practical sense; but now, with entirely perfect intellect, contending
with evil; conquering it utterly, casting it away for ever, and
rising beyond it into magnificence of rest.</p>

<p><a name="ft1z" id="ft1z" href="#fa1z"><span class="fn">1</span></a> As I was correcting these pages, there was put into my hand a little
work by a very dear friend&mdash;&ldquo;Travels and Study in Italy,&rdquo; by Charles Eliot
Norton;&mdash;I have not yet been able to do more than glance at it; but my
impression is, that by carefully reading it, together with the essay by the
same writer on the Vita Nuova of Dante, a more just estimate may be formed
of the religious art of Italy than by the study of any other books yet existing.
At least, I have seen none in which the tone of thought was at once so
tender and so just.</p>

<p>I had hoped, before concluding this book, to have given it higher value
by extracts from the works which have chiefly helped or guided me, especially
from the writings of Helps, Lowell, and the Rev. A. J. Scott. But if I
were to begin making such extracts, I find that I should not know, either in
justice or affection, how to end.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE TWO BOYHOODS.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Born</span> half-way between the mountains and the sea&mdash;that
young George of Castelfranco&mdash;of the Brave Castle:&mdash;Stout
George they called him, George of Georges, so goodly a boy he
was&mdash;Giorgione.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought what a world his eyes opened on&mdash;fair,
searching eyes of youth? What a world of mighty life,
from those mountain roots to the shore;&mdash;of loveliest life, when
he went down, yet so young, to the marble city&mdash;and became
himself as a fiery heart to it?</p>

<p>A city of marble, did I say? nay, rather a golden city, paved
with emerald. For truly, every pinnacle and turret glanced or
glowed, overlaid with gold, or bossed with jasper. Beneath, the
unsullied sea drew in deep breathing, to and fro, its eddies of
green wave. Deep-hearted, majestic, terrible as the sea,&mdash;the
men of Venice moved in sway of power and war; pure as her pillars
of alabaster, stood her mothers and maidens; from foot to
brow, all noble, walked her knights; the low bronzed gleaming
of sea-rusted armor shot angrily under their blood-red mantle-folds.
Fearless, faithful, patient, impenetrable, implacable,&mdash;every
word a fate&mdash;sate her senate. In hope and honor, lulled
by flowing of wave around their isles of sacred sand, each with
his name written and the cross graved at his side, lay her dead.
A wonderful piece of world. Rather, itself a world. It lay
along the face of the waters, no larger, as its captains saw it from
their masts at evening, than a bar of sunset that could not pass
away; but, for its power, it must have seemed to them as if they
were sailing in the expanse of heaven, and this a great planet,
whose orient edge widened through ether. A world from which
all ignoble care and petty thoughts were banished, with all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
common and poor elements of life. No foulness, nor tumult, in
those tremulous streets, that filled, or fell, beneath the moon;
but rippled music of majestic change, or thrilling silence. No
weak walls could rise above them; no low-roofed cottage, nor
straw-built shed. Only the strength as of rock, and the finished
setting of stones most precious. And around them, far as the
eye could reach, still the soft moving of stainless waters, proudly
pure; as not the flower, so neither the thorn nor the thistle,
could grow in the glancing fields. Ethereal strength of Alps,
dream-like, vanishing in high procession beyond the Torcellan
shore; blue islands of Paduan hills, poised in the golden west.
Above, tree winds and fiery clouds ranging at their will;&mdash;brightness
out of the north, and balm from the south, and the stars of
the evening and morning clear in the limitless light of arched
heaven and circling sea.</p>

<p>Such was Giorgione&rsquo;s school&mdash;such Titian&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>§ 2. Near the south-west corner of Covent Garden, a square
brick pit or well is formed by a close-set block of houses, to the
back windows of which it admits a few rays of light. Access to
the bottom of it is obtained out of Maiden Lane, through a low
archway and an iron gate; and if you stand long enough under
the archway to accustom your eyes to the darkness, you may see
on the left hand a narrow door, which formerly gave quiet access
to a respectable barber&rsquo;s shop, of which the front window, looking
into Maiden Lane, is still extant, filled in this year (1860),
with a row of bottles, connected, in some defunct manner, with
a brewer&rsquo;s business. A more fashionable neighborhood, it is
said, eighty years ago than now&mdash;never certainly a cheerful one&mdash;wherein
a boy being born on St. George&rsquo;s day, 1775, began soon
after to take interest in the world of Covent Garden, and put to
service such spectacles of life as it afforded.</p>

<p>§ 3. No knights to be seen there, nor, I imagine, many beautiful
ladies; their costume at least disadvantageous, depending
much on incumbency of hat and feather, and short waists; the
majesty of men founded similarly on shoebuckles and wigs;&mdash;impressive
enough when Reynolds will do his best for it; but
not suggestive of much ideal delight to a boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bello ovile dov&rsquo; io dormii agnello:&rdquo; of things beautiful,
besides men and women, dusty sunbeams up or down the street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
on summer mornings; deep furrowed cabbage leaves at the
greengrocer&rsquo;s; magnificence of oranges in wheelbarrows round
the corner; and Thames&rsquo; shore within three minutes&rsquo; race.</p>

<p>§ 4. None of these things very glorious; the best, however,
that England, it seems, was then able to provide for a boy of
gift: who, such as they are, loves them&mdash;never, indeed, forgets
them. The short waists modify to the last his visions of Greek
ideal. His foregrounds had always a succulent cluster or two of
greengrocery at the corners. Enchanted oranges gleam in Covent
Gardens of the Hesperides; and great ships go to pieces in order
to scatter chests of them on the waves. That mist of early sunbeams
in the London dawn crosses, many and many a time, the
clearness of Italian air; and by Thames&rsquo; shore, with its stranded
barges and glidings of red sail, dearer to us than Lucerne lake or
Venetian lagoon,&mdash;by Thames&rsquo; shore we will die.</p>

<p>§ 5. With such circumstance round him in youth, let us note
what necessary effects followed upon the boy. I assume him to
have had Giorgione&rsquo;s sensibility (and more than Giorgione&rsquo;s, if
that be possible) to color and form. I tell you farther, and this
fact you may receive trustfully, that his sensibility to human
affection and distress was no less keen than even his sense for
natural beauty&mdash;heart-sight deep as eye-sight.</p>

<p>Consequently, he attaches himself with the faithfullest child-love
to everything that bears an image of the place he was born
in. No matter how ugly it is,&mdash;has it anything about it like
Maiden Lane, or like Thames&rsquo; shore? If so, it shall be painted
for their sake. Hence, to the very close of life, Turner could
endure ugliness which no one else, of the same sensibility, would
have borne with for an instant. Dead brick walls, blank square
windows, old clothes, market-womanly types of humanity&mdash;anything
fishy and muddy, like Billingsgate or Hungerford
Market, had great attraction for him; black barges, patched
sails, and every possible condition of fog.</p>

<p>§ 6. You will find these tolerations and affections guiding or
sustaining him to the last hour of his life; the notablest of all
such endurances being that of dirt. No Venetian ever draws
anything foul; but Turner devoted picture after picture to the
illustration of effects of dinginess, smoke, soot, dust, and dusty
texture; old sides of boats, weedy roadside vegetation, dung-hills,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
straw-yards, and all the soilings and stains of every common
labor.</p>

<p>And more than this, he not only could endure, but enjoyed
and looked for <i>litter</i>, like Covent Garden wreck after the market.
His pictures are often full of it, from side to side; their foregrounds
differ from all others in the natural way that things
have of lying about in them. Even his richest vegetation, in
ideal work, is confused; and he delights in shingle, débris, and
heaps of fallen stones. The last words he ever spoke to me about
a picture were in gentle exaltation about his St. Gothard: &ldquo;that
<i>litter</i> of stones which I endeavored to represent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 7. The second great result of this Covent Garden training
was, understanding of and regard for the poor, whom the Venetians,
we saw, despised; whom, contrarily, Turner loved, and
more than loved&mdash;understood. He got no romantic sight of
them, but an infallible one, as he prowled about the end of his
lane, watching night effects in the wintry streets; nor sight of
the poor alone, but of the poor in direct relations with the rich.
He knew, in good and evil, what both classes thought of, and
how they dwelt with, each other.</p>

<p>Reynolds and Gainsborough, bred in country villages, learned
there the country boy&rsquo;s reverential theory of &ldquo;the squire,&rdquo; and
kept it. They painted the squire and the squire&rsquo;s lady as centres
of the movements of the universe, to the end of their lives. But
Turner perceived the younger squire in other aspects about his
lane, occurring prominently in its night scenery, as a dark figure,
or one of two, against the moonlight. He saw also the working
of city commerce, from endless warehouse, towering over Thames,
to the back shop in the lane, with its stale herrings&mdash;highly interesting
these last; one of his fathers best friends, whom he
often afterwards visited affectionately at Bristol, being a fish-monger
and glueboiler; which gives us a friendly turn of mind
towards herring-fishing, whaling, Calais poissardes, and many
other of our choicest subjects in after life; all this being connected
with that mysterious forest below London Bridge on one
side;&mdash;and, on the other, with these masses of human power and
national wealth which weigh upon us, at Covent Garden here,
with strange compression, and crush us into narrow Hand Court.</p>

<p>§ 8. &ldquo;That mysterious forest below London Bridge&rdquo;&mdash;better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
for the boy than wood of pine, or grove of myrtle. How he
must have tormented the watermen, beseeching them to let him
crouch anywhere in the bows, quiet as a log, so only that he
might get floated down there among the ships, and round and
round the ships, and with the ships, and by the ships, and under
the ships, staring and clambering;&mdash;these the only quite beautiful
things he can see in all the world, except the sky; but these,
when the sun is on their sails, filling or falling, endlessly disordered
by sway of tide and stress of anchorage, beautiful unspeakably;
which ships also are inhabited by glorious creatures&mdash;redfaced
sailors, with pipes, appearing over the gunwales, true
knights, over their castle parapets&mdash;the most angelic beings in
the whole compass of London world. And Trafalgar happening
long before we can draw ships, we, nevertheless, coax all current
stories out of the wounded sailors, do our best at present to show
Nelson&rsquo;s funeral streaming up the Thames; and vow that Trafalgar
shall have its tribute of memory some day. Which, accordingly,
is accomplished&mdash;once, with all our might, for its death;
twice, with all our might, for its victory; thrice, in pensive farewell
to the old Temeraire, and, with it, to that order of things.</p>

<p>§ 9. Now this fond companying with sailors must have divided
his time, it appears to me, pretty equally between Covent Garden
and Wapping (allowing for incidental excursions to Chelsea on
one side, and Greenwich on the other), which time he would
spend pleasantly, but not magnificently, being limited in pocket-money,
and leading a kind of &ldquo;Poor-Jack&rdquo; life on the river.</p>

<p>In some respects, no life could be better for a lad. But it
was not calculated to make his ear fine to the niceties of language,
nor form his moralities on an entirely regular standard.
Picking up his first scraps of vigorous English chiefly at Deptford
and in the markets, and his first ideas of female tenderness
and beauty among nymphs of the barge and the barrow,&mdash;another
boy might, perhaps, have become what people usually term
&ldquo;vulgar.&rdquo; But the original make and frame of Turner&rsquo;s mind
being not vulgar, but as nearly as possible a combination of the
minds of Keats and Dante, joining capricious waywardness, and
intense openness to every fine pleasure of sense, and hot defiance
of formal precedent, with a quite infinite tenderness, generosity,
and desire of justice and truth&mdash;this kind of mind did not become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
vulgar, but very tolerant of vulgarity, even fond of it in
some forms; and, on the outside, visibly infected by it, deeply
enough; the curious result, in its combination of elements,
being to most people wholly incomprehensible. It was as if a
cable had been woven of blood-crimson silk, and then tarred on
the outside. People handled it, and the tar came off on their
hands; red gleams were seen through the black, underneath, at
the places where it had been strained. Was it ochre?&mdash;said the
world&mdash;or red lead?</p>

<p>§ 10. Schooled thus in manners, literature, and general moral
principles at Chelsea and Wapping, we have finally to inquire
concerning the most important point of all. We have seen the
principal differences between this boy and Giorgione, as respects
sight of the beautiful, understanding of poverty, of commerce,
and of order of battle; then follows another cause of difference
in our training&mdash;not slight,&mdash;the aspect of religion, namely, in
the neighborhood of Covent Garden. I say the aspect; for that
was all the lad could judge by. Disposed, for the most part, to
learn chiefly by his eyes, in this special matter he finds there is
really no other way of learning. His father taught him &ldquo;to lay
one penny upon another.&rdquo; Of mother&rsquo;s teaching, we hear of none;
of parish pastoral teaching, the reader may guess how much.</p>

<p>§ 11. I chose Giorgione rather than Veronese to help me in
carrying out this parallel; because I do not find in Giorgione&rsquo;s
work any of the early Venetian monarchist element. He seems
to me to have belonged more to an abstract contemplative school.
I may be wrong in this; it is no matter;&mdash;suppose it were so,
and that he came down to Venice somewhat recusant, or insentient,
concerning the usual priestly doctrines of his day,&mdash;how
would the Venetian religion, from an outer intellectual standing-point,
have <i>looked</i> to him?</p>

<p>§ 12. He would have seen it to be a religion indisputably
powerful in human affairs; often very harmfully so; sometimes
devouring widows&rsquo; houses, and consuming the strongest and
fairest from among the young; freezing into merciless bigotry
the policy of the old: also, on the other hand, animating national
courage, and raising souls, otherwise sordid, into heroism:
on the whole, always a real and great power; served with daily
sacrifice of gold, time, and thought; putting forth its claims, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
hypocritically, at least in bold hypocrisy, not waiving any atom
of them in doubt or fear; and, assuredly, in large measure, sincere,
believing in itself, and believed: a goodly system, moreover,
in aspect; gorgeous, harmonious, mysterious;&mdash;a thing
which had either to be obeyed or combated, but could not be
scorned. A religion towering over all the city&mdash;many buttressed&mdash;luminous
in marble stateliness, as the dome of our Lady of
Safety shines over the sea; many-voiced also, giving, over all the
eastern seas, to the sentinel his watchword, to the soldier his
war-cry; and, on the lips of all who died for Venice, shaping
the whisper of death.</p>

<p>§ 13. I suppose the boy Turner to have regarded the religion
of his city also from an external intellectual standing-point.</p>

<p>What did he see in Maiden Lane?</p>

<p>Let not the reader be offended with me; I am willing to let
him describe, at his own pleasure, what Turner saw there; but
to me, it seems to have been this. A religion maintained occasionally,
even the whole length of the lane, at point of constable&rsquo;s
staff; but, at other times, placed under the custody of the beadle,
within certain black and unstately iron railings of St. Paul&rsquo;s,
Covent Garden. Among the wheelbarrows and over the vegetables,
no perceptible dominance of religion; in the narrow, disquieted
streets, none; in the tongues, deeds, daily ways of
Maiden Lane, little. Some honesty, indeed, and English industry,
and kindness of heart, and general idea of justice; but faith,
of any national kind, shut up from one Sunday to the next, not
artistically beautiful even in those Sabbatical exhibitions; its
paraphernalia being chiefly of high pews, heavy elocution, and
cold grimness of behavior.</p>

<p>What chiaroscuro belongs to it&mdash;(dependent mostly on candlelight),&mdash;we
will, however, draw considerately; no goodliness of
escutcheon, nor other respectability being omitted, and the best of
their results confessed, a meek old woman and a child being let
into a pew, for whom the reading by candlelight will be beneficial.<a name="fa1aa" id="fa1aa" href="#ft1aa"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span></p>

<p>§ 14. For the rest, this religion seems to him discreditable&mdash;discredited&mdash;not
believing in itself, putting forth its authority in
a cowardly way, watching how far it might be tolerated, continually
shrinking, disclaiming, fencing, finessing; divided against
itself, not by stormy rents, but by thin fissures, and splittings of
plaster from the walls. Not to be either obeyed, or combated,
by an ignorant, yet clear-sighted youth; only to be scorned.
And scorned not one whit the less, though also the dome dedicated
to <i>it</i> looms high over distant winding of the Thames; as
St. Mark&rsquo;s campanile rose, for goodly landmark, over mirage of
lagoon. For St. Mark ruled over life; the Saint of London over
death; St. Mark over St. Mark&rsquo;s Place, but St. Paul over St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.</p>

<p>§ 15. Under these influences pass away the first reflective
hours of life, with such conclusion as they can reach. In consequence
of a fit of illness, he was taken&mdash;I cannot ascertain in
what year&mdash;to live with an aunt, at Brentford; and here, I believe,
received some schooling, which he seems to have snatched
vigorously; getting knowledge, at least by translation, of the
more picturesque classical authors, which he turned presently to
use, as we shall see. Hence also, walks about Putney and
Twickenham in the summer time acquainted him with the look
of English meadow-ground in its restricted states of paddock and
park; and with some round-headed appearances of trees, and
stately entrances to houses of mark: the avenue at Bushy, and
the iron gates and carved pillars of Hampton, impressing him
apparently with great awe and admiration; so that in after life
his little country house is,&mdash;of all places in the world,&mdash;at
Twickenham! Of swans and reedy shores he now learns the soft
motion and the green mystery, in a way not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>§ 16. And at last fortune wills that the lad&rsquo;s true life shall
begin; and one summer&rsquo;s evening, after various wonderful stage-coach
experiences on the north road, which gave him a love of
stage-coaches ever after, he finds himself sitting alone among the
Yorkshire hills.<a name="fa2aa" id="fa2aa" href="#ft2aa"><span class="sp">2</span></a> For the first time, the silence of Nature round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
him, her freedom sealed to him, her glory opened to him. Peace
at last; no roll of cart-wheel, nor mutter of sullen voices in the
back shop; but curlew-cry in space of heaven, and welling of
bell-toned streamlet by its shadowy rock. Freedom at last.
Dead-wall, dark railing, fenced field, gated garden, all passed
away like the dream of a prisoner; and behold, far as foot or eye
can race or range, the moor, and cloud. Loveliness at last. It
is here then, among these deserted vales! Not among men.
Those pale, poverty-struck, or cruel faces;&mdash;that multitudinous,
marred humanity&mdash;are not the only things that God has made.
Here is something He has made which no one has marred. Pride
of purple rocks, and river pools of blue, and tender wilderness of
glittering trees, and misty lights of evening on immeasurable
hills.</p>

<p>§ 17. Beauty, and freedom, and peace; and yet another
teacher, graver than these. Sound preaching at last here, in
Kirkstall crypt, concerning fate and life. Here, where the dark
pool reflects the chancel pillars, and the cattle lie in unhindered
rest, the soft sunshine on their dappled bodies, instead of priests&rsquo;
vestments; their white furry hair ruffled a little, fitfully, by the
evening wind, deep-scented from the meadow thyme.</p>

<p>§ 18. Consider deeply the import to him of this, his first
sight of ruin, and compare it with the effect of the architecture
that was around Giorgione. There were indeed aged buildings,
at Venice, in his time, but none in decay. All ruin was removed,
and its place filled as quickly as in our London; but filled always
by architecture loftier and more wonderful than that whose
place it took, the boy himself happy to work upon the walls of
it; so that the idea of the passing away of the strength of men
and beauty of their works never could occur to him sternly.
Brighter and brighter the cities of Italy had been rising and
broadening on hill and plain, for three hundred years. He saw
only strength and immortality, could not but paint both; conceived
the form of man as deathless, calm with power, and fiery
with life.</p>

<p>§ 19. Turner saw the exact reverse of this. In the present
work of men, meanness, aimlessness, unsightliness: thin-walled,
lath-divided, narrow-garreted houses of clay; booths of a darksome
Vanity Fair, busily base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span></p>

<p>But on Whitby Hill, and by Bolton Brook, remained traces
of other handiwork. Men who could build had been there; and
who also had wrought, not merely for their own days. But to
what purpose? Strong faith, and steady hands, and patient
souls&mdash;can this, then, be all you have left! this the sum of your
doing on the earth!&mdash;a nest whence the night-owl may whimper
to the brook, and a ribbed skeleton of consumed arches, looming
above the bleak banks of mist, from its cliff to the sea?</p>

<p>As the strength of men to Giorgione, to Turner their weakness
and vileness, were alone visible. They themselves, unworthy
or ephemeral; their work, despicable, or decayed. In the
Venetian&rsquo;s eyes, all beauty depended on man&rsquo;s presence and
pride; in Turner&rsquo;s, on the solitude he had left, and the humiliation
he had suffered.</p>

<p>§ 20. And thus the fate and issue of all his work were determined
at once. He must be a painter of the strength of nature,
there was no beauty elsewhere than in that; he must paint also
the labor and sorrow and passing away of men; this was the
great human truth visible to him.</p>

<p>Their labor, their sorrow, and their death. Mark the three.
Labor; by sea and land, in field and city, at forge and furnace,
helm and plough. No pastoral indolence nor classic pride shall
stand between him and the troubling of the world; still less between
him and the toil of his country,&mdash;blind, tormented, unwearied,
marvellous England.</p>

<p>§ 21. Also their Sorrow; Ruin of all their glorious work,
passing away of their thoughts and their honor, mirage of pleasure,
<span class="sc">Fallacy of Hope</span>; gathering of weed on temple step;
gaining of wave on deserted strand; weeping of the mother for
the children, desolate by her breathless first-born in the streets
of the city,<a name="fa3aa" id="fa3aa" href="#ft3aa"><span class="sp">3</span></a> desolate by her last sons slain, among the beasts of
the field.<a name="fa4aa" id="fa4aa" href="#ft4aa"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>§ 22. And their Death. That old Greek question again;&mdash;yet
unanswered. The unconquerable spectre still flitting among
the forest trees at twilight; rising ribbed out of the sea-sand;&mdash;white,
a strange Aphrodite,&mdash;out of the sea-foam; stretching its
gray, cloven wings among the clouds; turning the light of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
sunsets into blood. This has to be looked upon, and in a more
terrible shape than ever Salvator or Durer saw it. The wreck
of one guilty country does not infer the ruin of all countries, and
need not cause general terror respecting the laws of the universe.
Neither did the orderly and narrow succession of domestic joy
and sorrow in a small German community bring the question in
its breadth, or in any unresolvable shape, before the mind of
Durer. But the English death&mdash;the European death of the nineteenth
century&mdash;was of another range and power; more terrible
a thousand-fold in its merely physical grasp and grief; more terrible,
incalculably, in its mystery and shame. What were the
robber&rsquo;s casual pang, or the rage of the flying skirmish, compared
to the work of the axe, and the sword, and the famine, which
was done during this man&rsquo;s youth on all the hills and plains of
the Christian earth, from Moscow to Gibraltar. He was eighteen
years old when Napoleon came down on Arcola. Look on the
map of Europe, and count the blood-stains on it, between Arcola
and Waterloo.</p>

<p>§ 23. Not alone those blood-stains on the Alpine snow, and
the blue of the Lombard plain. The English death was before
his eyes also. No decent, calculable, consoled dying; no passing
to rest like that of the aged burghers of Nuremberg town. No
gentle processions to churchyards among the fields, the bronze
crests bossed deep on the memorial tablets, and the skylark singing
above them from among the corn. But the life trampled
out in the slime of the street, crushed to dust amidst the roaring
of the wheel, tossed countlessly away into howling winter wind
along five hundred leagues of rock-fanged shore. Or, worst of
all, rotted down to forgotten graves through years of ignorant
patience, and vain seeking for help from man, for hope in God&mdash;infirm,
imperfect yearning, as of motherless infants starving at
the dawn; oppressed royalties of captive thought, vague ague-fits
of bleak, amazed despair.</p>

<p>§ 24. A goodly landscape this, for the lad to paint, and under
a goodly light. Wide enough the light was, and clear; no more
Salvator&rsquo;s lurid chasm on jagged horizon, nor Durer&rsquo;s spotted
rest of sunny gleam on hedgerow and field; but light over all the
world. Full shone now its awful globe, one pallid charnel-house,&mdash;a
ball strewn bright with human ashes, glaring in poised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
sway beneath the sun, all blinding-white with death from pole to
pole,&mdash;death, not of myriads of poor bodies only, but of will, and
mercy, and conscience; death, not once inflicted on the flesh,
but daily, fastening on the spirit; death, not silent or patient,
waiting his appointed hour, but voiceful, venomous; death with
the taunting word, and burning grasp, and infixed sting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.&rdquo; The word is
spoken in our ears continually to other reapers than the angels&mdash;to
the busy skeletons that never tire for stooping. When the
measure of iniquity is full, and it seems that another day might
bring repentance and redemption,&mdash;&ldquo;Put ye in the sickle.&rdquo;
When the young life has been wasted all away, and the eyes are
just opening upon the tracks of ruin, and faint resolution rising
in the heart for nobler things,&mdash;&ldquo;Put ye in the sickle.&rdquo; When
the roughest blows of fortune have been borne long and bravely,
and the hand is just stretched to grasp its goal,&mdash;&ldquo;Put ye in the
sickle.&rdquo; And when there are but a few in the midst of a nation,
to save it, or to teach, or to cherish; and all its life is bound up
in those few golden ears,&mdash;&ldquo;Put ye in the sickle, pale reapers,
and pour hemlock for your feast of harvest home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the sight which opened on the young eyes, this the
watchword sounding within the heart of Turner in his youth.</p>

<p>So taught, and prepared for his life&rsquo;s labor, sate the boy at
last alone among his fair English hills; and began to paint, with
cautious toil, the rocks, and fields, and trickling brooks, and
soft, white clouds of heaven.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. The</span> work of Turner, in its first period, is said in my
account of his drawings at the National Gallery to be distinguished
by &ldquo;boldness of handling, generally gloomy tendency
of mind, subdued color, and perpetual reference to precedent in
composition.&rdquo; I must refer the reader to those two catalogues<a name="fa1ab" id="fa1ab" href="#ft1ab"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
for a more special account of his early modes of technical study.
Here we are concerned only with the expression of that gloomy
tendency of mind, whose causes we are now better able to understand.</p>

<p>§ 2. It was prevented from overpowering him by his labor.
This, continual, and as tranquil in its course as a ploughman&rsquo;s
in the field, by demanding an admirable humility and patience,
averted the tragic passion of youth. Full of stern sorrow and
fixed purpose, the boy set himself to his labor silently and
meekly, like a workman&rsquo;s child on its first day at the cotton-mill.
Without haste, but without relaxation,&mdash;accepting all
modes and means of progress, however painful or humiliating, he
took the burden on his shoulder and began his march. There
was nothing so little, but that he noticed it; nothing so great
but he began preparations to cope with it. For some time his
work is, apparently, feelingless, so patient and mechanical are
the first essays. It gains gradually in power and grasp; there is
no perceptible <i>aim</i> at freedom, or at fineness, but the force insensibly
becomes swifter, and the touch finer. The color is always
dark or subdued.</p>

<p>§ 3. Of the first forty subjects which he exhibited at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
Royal Academy, thirty-one are architectural, and of these
twenty-one are of elaborate Gothic architecture (Peterborough
cathedral, Lincoln cathedral, Malmesbury abbey, Tintern abbey,
&amp;c.). I look upon the discipline given to his hand by these formal
drawings as of the highest importance. His mind was also
gradually led by them into a calmer pensiveness.<a name="fa2ab" id="fa2ab" href="#ft2ab"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Education
amidst country possessing architectural remains of some noble
kind, I believe to be wholly essential to the progress of a landscape
artist. The first verses he ever attached to a picture were
in 1798. They are from Paradise Lost, and refer to a picture of
Morning, on the Coniston Fells:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="noind">By glancing over the verses, which in following years<a name="fa3ab" id="fa3ab" href="#ft3ab"><span class="sp">3</span></a> he
quotes from Milton, Thompson, and Mallet, it may be seen at
once how his mind was set, so far as natural scenes were concerned,
on rendering atmospheric effect;&mdash;and so far as emotion
was to be expressed, how consistently it was melancholy.</p>

<p>He paints, first of heroic or meditative subjects, the Fifth
Plague of Egypt; next, the Tenth Plague of Egypt. His first
tribute to the memory of Nelson is the &ldquo;Battle of the Nile,&rdquo;
1799. I presume an unimportant picture, as his power was not
then availably developed. His first classical subject is Narcissus
and Echo, in 1805:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The year following he summons his whole strength, and
paints what we might suppose would be a happier subject, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
Garden of the Hesperides. This being the most important picture
of the first period, I will analyze it completely.</p>

<p>§ 4. The fable of the Hesperides had, it seems to me, in the
Greek mind two distinct meanings; the first referring to natural
phenomena, and the second to moral. The natural meaning of
it I believe to have been this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Garden of the Hesperides was supposed to exist in the
westernmost part of the Cyrenaica; it was generally the expression
for the beauty and luxuriant vegetation of the coast of
Africa in that district. The centre of the Cyrenaica &ldquo;is occupied
by a moderately elevated table-land, whose edge runs parallel
to the coast, to which it sinks down in a succession of terraces,
clothed with verdure, intersected by mountain streams running
through ravines filled with the richest vegetation; well
watered by frequent rains, exposed to the cool sea breeze from
the north, and sheltered by the mass of the mountain from the
sands and hot winds of the Sahara.&rdquo;<a name="fa4ab" id="fa4ab" href="#ft4ab"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>The Greek colony of Cyrene itself was founded ten miles from
the sea-shore, &ldquo;in a spot backed by the mountains on the south,
and thus sheltered from the fiery blasts of the desert; while at
the height of about 1800 feet an inexhaustible spring bursts forth
amidst luxuriant vegetation, and pours its waters down to the
Mediterranean through a most beautiful ravine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nymphs of the west, or Hesperides, are therefore, I believe,
as natural types, the representatives of the soft western
winds and sunshine, which were in this district most favorable
to vegetation. In this sense they are called daughters of Atlas
and Hesperis, the western winds being cooled by the snow of
Atlas. The dragon, on the contrary, is the representative of the
Sahara wind, or Simoom, which blew over the garden from
among the hills on the south, and forbade all advance of cultivation
beyond their ridge. Whether this was the physical meaning
of the tradition in the Greek mind or not, there can be no doubt
of its being Turner&rsquo;s first interpretation of it. A glance at the
picture may determine this: a clear fountain being made the
principal object in the foreground,&mdash;a bright and strong torrent
in the distance,&mdash;while the dragon, wrapped in flame and whirlwind,
watches from the top of the cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span></p>

<p>§ 5. But, both in the Greek mind and Turner&rsquo;s, this natural
meaning of the legend was a completely subordinate one. The
moral significance of it lay far deeper. In the second, but principal
sense, the Hesperides were not daughters of Atlas, nor connected
with the winds of the west, but with its splendor. They
are properly the nymphs of the sunset, and are the daughters of
night, having many brothers and sisters, of whom I shall take
Hesiod&rsquo;s account.</p>

<p>§ 6. &ldquo;And the Night begat Doom, and short-withering Fate,
and Death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And begat Sleep, and the company of Dreams, and Censure,
and Sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Hesperides, who keep the golden fruit beyond the
mighty Sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Destinies, and the Spirits of merciless punishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Jealousy, and Deceit, and Wanton Love; and Old
Age, that fades away; and Strife, whose will endures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 7. We have not, I think, hitherto quite understood the
Greek feeling about those nymphs and their golden apples, coming
as a light in the midst of cloud; between Censure, and Sorrow,&mdash;and
the Destinies. We must look to the precise meaning
of Hesiod&rsquo;s words, in order to get the force of the passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Night begat Doom;&rdquo; that is to say, the doom of unforeseen
accident&mdash;doom essentially of darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And short-withering Fate.&rdquo; Ill translated. I cannot do
it better. It means especially the sudden fate which brings untimely
end to all purpose, and cuts off youth and its promise;
called, therefore (the epithet hardly ever leaving it), &ldquo;black
Fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Death.&rdquo; This is the universal, inevitable death,
opposed to the interfering, untimely death. These three are
named as the elder children. Hesiod pauses, and repeats the
word &ldquo;begat&rdquo; before going on to number the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And begat Sleep, and the company of Dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <i>Censure</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Momus,&rdquo; the Spirit of Blame&mdash;the spirit
which desires to blame rather than to praise; false, base, unhelpful,
unholy judgment;&mdash;ignorant and blind, child of the
Night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sorrow.&rdquo; Accurately, sorrow of mourning; the sorrow
of the night, when no man can work; of the night that falls
when what was the light of the eyes is taken from us; lamenting,
sightless sorrow, without hope,&mdash;child of Night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Hesperides.&rdquo; We will come back to these.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Destinies, and the Spirits of Merciless Punishment.&rdquo;
These are the great Fates which have rule over conduct;
the first fate spoken of (short-withering) is that which
has rule over occurrence. These great Fates are Clotho, Lachesis,
Atropos. Their three powers are&mdash;Clotho&rsquo;s over the clue,
the thread, or connecting energy,&mdash;that is, the conduct of life;
Lachesis&rsquo; over the lot&mdash;that is to say, the chance which warps,
entangles, or bends the course of life. Atropos, inflexible, cuts
the thread for ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Jealousy,&rdquo; especially the jealousy of Fortune, in
balancing all good by evil. The Greeks had a peculiar dread
of this form of fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Deceit, and sensual Love. And Old Age that fades,
and Strife that endures;&rdquo; that is to say, old age, which, growing
not in wisdom, is marked only by its failing power&mdash;by the gradual
gaining of darkness on the faculties, and helplessness on the
frame, such age is the forerunner of true death&mdash;the child of
Night. &ldquo;And Strife,&rdquo; the last and the mightiest, the nearest to
man of the Night-children&mdash;blind leader of the blind.</p>

<p>§ 8. Understanding thus whose sisters they are, let us consider
of the Hesperides themselves&mdash;spoken of commonly as the
&ldquo;Singing Nymphs.&rdquo; They are four.</p>

<p>Their names are Æglé,&mdash;Brightness; Erytheia,&mdash;Blushing;
Hestia,&mdash;the (spirit of the) Hearth; Arethusa,&mdash;the Ministering.</p>

<p>O English reader! hast thou ever heard of these fair and
true daughters of Sunset, beyond the mighty sea?</p>

<p>And was it not well to trust to such keepers the guarding of
the golden fruit which the earth gave to Juno at her marriage?
Not fruit only: fruit on the tree, given by the earth, the great
mother, to Juno (female power), at her marriage with Jupiter,
or <i>ruling</i> manly power (distinguished from the tried and <i>agonizing</i>
strength of Hercules). I call Juno, briefly, female power.
She is, especially, the goddess presiding over marriage, regarding
the woman as the mistress of a household. Vesta (the goddess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
of the hearth<a name="fa5ab" id="fa5ab" href="#ft5ab"><span class="sp">5</span></a>), with Ceres, and Venus, are variously dominant
over marriage, as the fulfilment of love; but Juno is pre-eminently
the housewives&rsquo; goddess. She, therefore, represents,
in her character, whatever good or evil may result from female
ambition, or desire of power: and, as to a housewife, the earth
presents its golden fruit to her, which she gives to two kinds of
guardians. The wealth of the earth, as the source of household
peace and plenty, is watched by the singing nymphs&mdash;the Hesperides.
But, as the source of household sorrow and desolation,
it is watched by the Dragon.</p>

<p>We must, therefore, see who the Dragon was, and what kind
of dragon.</p>

<p>§ 9. The reader will, perhaps, remember that we traced, in
an earlier chapter, the birth of the Gorgons, through Phorcys
and Ceto, from Nereus. The youngest child of Phorcys and
Ceto is the Dragon of the Hesperides; but this latest descent is
not, as in Northern traditions, a sign of fortunateness: on the
contrary, the children of Nereus receive gradually more and
more terror and power, as they are later born, till this last of the
Nereids unites horror and power at their utmost. Observe the
gradual change. Nereus himself is said to have been perfectly
<i>true</i> and <i>gentle</i>.</p>

<p>This is Hesiod&rsquo;s account of him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Pontus begat Nereus, simple and true, the oldest of
children; but they call him the aged man, in that he is errorless
and kind; neither forgets he what is right; but knows all just
and gentle counsel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 10. Now the children of Nereus, like the Hesperides themselves,
bear a twofold typical character; one physical, the other
moral. In his physical symbolism, Nereus himself is the calm
and gentle sea, from which rise, in gradual increase of terror,
the clouds and storms. In his moral character, Nereus is the
type of the deep, pure, rightly-tempered human mind, from
which, in gradual degeneracy, spring the troubling passions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span></p>

<p>Keeping this double meaning in view, observe the whole line
of descent to the Hesperides&rsquo; Dragon. Nereus, by the earth,
begets (1) Thaumas (the wonderful), physically, the father of
the Rainbow; morally, the type of the enchantments and dangers
of imagination. His grandchildren, besides the Rainbow,
are the Harpies. 2. Phorcys (Orcus?), physically, the treachery
or devouring spirit of the sea; morally, covetousness or malignity
of heart. 3. Ceto, physically, the deep places of the sea;
morally, secretness of heart, called &ldquo;fair-cheeked,&rdquo; because tranquil
in outward aspect. 4. Eurybia (wide strength), physically,
the flowing, especially the tidal power of the sea (she, by one of
the sons of Heaven, becomes the mother of three great Titans,
one of whom, Astræus, and the Dawn, are the parents of the
four Winds); morally, the healthy passion of the heart. Thus
far the children of Nereus.</p>

<p>§ 11. Next, Phorcys and Ceto, in their physical characters
(the grasping or devouring of the sea, reaching out over the land
and its depth), beget the Clouds and Storms&mdash;namely, first, the
Graiæ, or soft rain-clouds; then the Gorgons, or storm-clouds;
and youngest and last, the Hesperides&rsquo; Dragon&mdash;Volcanic or
earth-storm, associated, in conception, with the Simoom and fiery
African winds.</p>

<p>But, in its moral significance, the descent is this. Covetousness,
or malignity (Phorcys), and Secretness (Ceto), beget, first,
the darkening passions, whose hair is always gray; then the
stormy and merciless passions, brazen-winged (the Gorgons), of
whom the dominant, Medusa, is ice-cold, turning all who look
on her to stone. And, lastly, the consuming (poisonous and volcanic)
passions&mdash;the &ldquo;flame-backed dragon,&rdquo; uniting the powers
of poison, and instant destruction. Now, the reader may
have heard, perhaps, in other books of Genesis than Hesiod&rsquo;s, of
a dragon being busy about a tree which bore apples, and of
crushing the head of that dragon; but seeing how, in the Greek
mind, this serpent was descended from the sea, he may, perhaps,
be surprised to remember another verse, bearing also on
the matter:&mdash;&ldquo;Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the
waters;&rdquo; and yet more surprised, going on with the Septuagint
version, to find where he is being led: &ldquo;Thou brakest the head
of the dragon, and gavest him to be meat to the Ethiopian people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
Thou didst tear asunder the strong fountains and the
storm-torrents; thou didst dry up the rivers of Etham, <span class="grk" title="pêgas
kai cheimarrhous">&#960;&#951;&#947;&#8048;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#967;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#8164;&#8165;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>, the Pegasus fountains&mdash;Etham on the edge of
the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 12. Returning then to Hesiod, we find he tells us of the
Dragon himself:&mdash;&ldquo;He, in the secret places of the desert land,
kept the all-golden apples in his great knots&rdquo; (coils of rope, or
extremities of anything). With which compare Euripides&rsquo; report
of him:&mdash;&ldquo;And Hercules came to the Hesperian dome, to
the singing maidens, plucking the apple fruit from the golden
petals; slaying the flame-backed dragon, who twined round and
round, kept guard in unapproachable spires&rdquo; (spirals or whirls,
as of a whirlwind-vortex).</p>

<p>Farther, we hear from other scattered syllables of tradition,
that this dragon was sleepless, and that he was able to take
various tones of human voice.</p>

<p>And we find a later tradition than Hesiod&rsquo;s calling him a
child of Typhon and Echidna. Now Typhon is volcanic storm,
generally the evil spirit of tumult.</p>

<p>Echidna (the adder) is a descendant of Medusa. She is a
daughter of Chrysaor (the lightning), by Calliröe (the fair flowing),
a daughter of Ocean;&mdash;that is to say, she joins the intense
fatality of the lightning with perfect gentleness. In form she is
half-maiden, half-serpent; therefore she is the spirit of all the
fatalest evil, veiled in gentleness: or, in one word, treachery;&mdash;having
dominion over many gentle things;&mdash;and chiefly over a
kiss, given, indeed, in another garden than that of the Hesperides,
yet in relation to keeping of treasure also.</p>

<p>§ 13. Having got this farther clue, let us look who it is
whom Dante makes the typical Spirit of Treachery. The eighth
or lowest pit of hell is given to its keeping; at the edge of
which pit, Virgil casts a <i>rope</i> down for a signal; instantly there
rises, as from the sea, &ldquo;as one returns who hath been down
to loose some anchor,&rdquo; &ldquo;the fell monster with the deadly
sting, who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls,
and firm embattled spears; and with his filth taints all the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Think for an instant of another place:&mdash;&ldquo;Sharp stones are
under him, he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.&rdquo; We must yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
keep to Dante, however. Echidna, remember, is half-maiden,
half-serpent;&mdash;hear what Dante&rsquo;s Fraud is like:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Forthwith that image vile of Fraud appear&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="i05">His head and upper part exposed on land,</p>
<p class="i05">But laid not on the shore his bestial train.</p>
<p class="i05">His face the semblance of a just man&rsquo;s wore,</p>
<p class="i05">So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;</p>
<p class="i05">The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws</p>
<p class="i05">Reach&rsquo;d to the armpits; and the back and breast,</p>
<p class="i05">And either side, were painted o&rsquo;er with nodes</p>
<p class="i05">And orbits. Colors variegated more</p>
<p class="i05">Nor Turks nor Tartars e&rsquo;er on cloth of state</p>
<p class="i05">With interchangeable embroidery wove,</p>
<p class="i05">Nor spread Arachne o&rsquo;er her curious loom.</p>
<p class="i05">As oft-times a light skiff moor&rsquo;d to the shore,</p>
<p class="i05">Stands part in water, part upon the land;</p>
<p class="i05">Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,</p>
<p class="i05">The beaver settles, watching for his prey;</p>
<p class="i05">So on the rim, that fenced the sand with rock,</p>
<p class="i05">Sat perch&rsquo;d the fiend of evil. In the void</p>
<p class="i05">Glancing, his tail upturn&rsquo;d, its venomous fork</p>
<p class="i05">With sting like scorpion&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>§ 14. You observe throughout this description the leaning on
the character of the <i>Sea</i> Dragon; a little farther on, his way of
flying is told us:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;As a small vessel backing out from land,</p>
<p class="i05">Her station quits; so thence the monster loos&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="i05">And, when he felt himself at large, turn&rsquo;d round</p>
<p class="i05">There, where the breast had been, his fork&rsquo;d tail.</p>
<p class="i05">Thus, like an eel, outstretch&rsquo;d at length he steer&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="i05">Gathering the air up with retractile claws.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>And lastly, his name is told us: Geryon. Whereupon, looking
back at Hesiod, we find that Geryon is Echidna&rsquo;s brother.
Man-serpent, therefore, in Dante, as Echidna is woman-serpent.</p>

<p>We find next that Geryon lived in the island of Erytheia,
(blushing), only another kind of blushing than that of the Hesperid
Erytheia. But it is on, also, a western island, and Geryon
kept red oxen on it (said to be near the red setting sun); and
Hercules kills him, as he does the Hesperian dragon: but in
order to be able to reach him, a golden boat is given to Hercules
by the Sun, to cross the sea in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span></p>

<p>§ 15. We will return to this part of the legend presently,
having enough of it now collected to get at the complete idea of
the Hesperian dragon, who is, in fine, the &ldquo;Pluto il gran nemico&rdquo;
of Dante; the demon of all evil passions connected with covetousness;
that is to say, essentially of fraud, rage, and gloom.
Regarded as the demon of Fraud, he is said to be descended from
the viper Echidna, full of deadly cunning, in whirl on whirl; as
the demon of consuming Rage, from Phorcys; as the demon of
Gloom, from Ceto;&mdash;in his watching and melancholy, he is sleepless
(compare the Micyllus dialogue of Lucian); breathing whirlwind
and fire, he is the destroyer, descended from Typhon as well
as Phorcys; having, moreover, with all these, the irresistible
strength of his ancestral sea.</p>

<p>§ 16. Now, look at him, as Turner has drawn him (p. 298).
I cannot reduce the creature to this scale without losing half his
power; his length, especially, seems to diminish more than it
should in proportion to his bulk. In the picture he is far in the
distance, cresting the mountain; and may be, perhaps, three-quarters
of a mile long. The actual length on the canvas is a
foot and eight inches; so that it may be judged how much he
loses by the reduction, not to speak of my imperfect etching,<a name="fa6ab" id="fa6ab" href="#ft6ab"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
and of the loss which, however well he might have been engraved,
he would still have sustained, in the impossibility of expressing
the lurid color of his armor, alternate bronze and blue.</p>

<p>§ 17. Still, the main points of him are discernible enough;
and among all the wonderful things that Turner did in his day,
I think this nearly the most wonderful. How far he had really
found out for himself the collateral bearings of the Hesperid
tradition I know not; but that he had got the main clue of it,
and knew who the Dragon was, there can be no doubt; the
strange thing is, that his conception of it throughout, down to
the minutest detail, fits every one of the circumstances of the
Greek traditions. There is, first, the Dragon&rsquo;s descent from
Medusa and Typhon, indicated in the serpent-clouds floating from
his head (compare my sketch of the Medusa-cloud, Plate 71);
then note the grovelling and ponderous body, ending in a serpent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
of which we do not see the end. He drags the weight of
it forward by his claws, not being able to lift himself from the
ground (&ldquo;Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell&rdquo;); then the
grip of the claws themselves as if they would clutch (rather than
tear) the rock itself into pieces; but chiefly, the designing of the
body. Remember, one of the essential characters of the creature,
as descended from Medusa, is its coldness and petrifying power;
this, in the demon of covetousness, must exist to the utmost;
breathing fire, he is yet himself of ice. Now, if I were merely
to draw this dragon as white, instead of dark, and take his claws
away, his body would become a representation of a greater glacier,
so nearly perfect, that I know no published engraving of glacier
breaking over a rocky brow so like the truth as this dragon&rsquo;s
shoulders would be, if they were thrown out in light; there being
only this difference, that they have the form, but not the fragility
of the ice; they are at once ice and iron. &ldquo;His bones are like
solid pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron; by his
neesings a light doth shine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 18. The strange unity of vertebrated action, and of a true
bony contour, infinitely varied in every vertebra, with this glacial
outline;&mdash;together with the adoption of the head of the Ganges
crocodile, the fish-eater, to show his sea descent (and this in the
year 1806, when hardly a single fossil saurian skeleton existed
within Turner&rsquo;s reach), renders the whole conception one of the
most curious exertions of the imaginative intellect with which I
am acquainted in the arts.</p>

<p>§ 19. Thus far, then, of the dragon; next, we have to examine
the conception of the Goddess of Discord. We must return for
a moment to the tradition about Geryon. I cannot yet decipher
the meaning of his oxen, said to be fed together with those of
Hades; nor of the journey of Hercules, in which, after slaying
Geryon, he returns through Europe like a border forager, driving
these herds, and led into farther battle in protection or recovery
of them. But it seems to me the main drift of the legend cannot
be mistaken; viz., that Geryon is the evil spirit of wealth,
as arising from commerce; hence, placed as a guardian of isles
in the most distant sea, and reached in a golden boat; while the
Hesperian dragon is the evil spirit of wealth, as possessed in
households; and associated, therefore, with the true household
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
guardians, or singing nymphs. Hercules (manly labor), slaying
both Geryon and Ladon, presents oxen and apples to Juno, who
is their proper mistress; but the Goddess of Discord, contriving
that one portion of this household wealth shall be ill bestowed
by Paris, he, according to Coleridge&rsquo;s interpretation, choosing
pleasure instead of wisdom or power;&mdash;there issue from this evil
choice the catastrophe of the Trojan war, and the wanderings of
Ulysses, which are essentially, both in the Iliad and Odyssey, the
troubling of household peace; terminating with the restoration
of this peace by repentance and patience; Helen and Penelope
seen at last sitting upon their household thrones, in the Hesperian
light of age.</p>

<p>§ 20. We have, therefore, to regard Discord, in the Hesperides
garden, eminently as the disturber of households, assuming a
different aspect from Homer&rsquo;s wild and fierce discord of war.
They are, nevertheless, one and the same power; for she changes
her aspect at will. I cannot get at the root of her name, Eris.
It seems to me as if it ought to have one in common with Erinnys
(Fury); but it means always contention, emulation, or competition,
either in mind or in words;&mdash;the final work of Eris is essentially
&ldquo;division,&rdquo; and she is herself always double-minded; shouts
two ways at once (in Iliad, xi. 6), and wears a mantle rent in half
(Æneid, viii. 702). Homer makes her loud-voiced, and insatiably
covetous. This last attribute is, with him, the source of her
usual title. She is little when she first is seen, then rises till her
head touches heaven. By Virgil she is called mad; and her hair
is of serpents, bound with bloody garlands.</p>

<p>§ 21. This is the conception first adopted by Turner, but
combined with another which he found in Spenser; only note
that there is some confusion in the minds of English poets between
Eris (Discord) and Até (Error), who is a daughter of Discord,
according to Hesiod. She is properly&mdash;mischievous error,
tender-footed; for she does not walk on the earth, but on heads
of men (Iliad, xix. 92); <i>i.e.</i> not on the solid ground, but on
human vain thoughts; therefore, her hair is glittering (Iliad,
xix. 126). I think she is mainly the confusion of mind coming
of pride, as Eris comes of covetousness; therefore, Homer makes
her a daughter of Jove. Spenser, under the name of Até, describes
Eris. I have referred to his account of her in my notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
of the Discord on the Ducal palace of Venice (remember the inscription
there, <i>Discordia sum, discordans</i>). But the stanzas
from which Turner derived his conception of her are these&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Als, as she double spake, so heard she double,</p>
<p class="i05">With matchlesse eares deformed and distort,</p>

<p class="i05">And that great golden chaine quite to divide,</p>
<p class="i05">With which it blessed Concord hath together tide.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>All these circumstances of decrepitude and distortion Turner
has followed, through hand and limb, with patient care: he has
added one final touch of his own. The nymph who brings the
apples to the goddess, offers her one in each hand; and Eris, of
the divided mind, cannot choose.</p>

<p>§ 22. One farther circumstance must be noted, in order to
complete our understanding of the picture,&mdash;the gloom extending,
not to the dragon only, but also to the fountain and the
tree of golden fruit. The reason of this gloom may be found in
two other passages of the authors from which Turner had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
his conception of Eris&mdash;Virgil and Spenser. For though the
Hesperides in their own character, as the nymphs of domestic
joy, are entirely bright (and the garden always bright around
them), yet seen or remembered in sorrow, or in the presence of
discord, they deepen distress. Their entirely happy character is
given by Euripides:&mdash;&ldquo;The fruit-planted shore of the Hesperides,&mdash;songstresses,&mdash;where
the ruler of the purple lake allows
not any more to the sailor his way, assigning the boundary of
Heaven, which Atlas holds; where the ambrosial fountains flow,
and the fruitful and divine land increases the happiness of the
gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to the thoughts of Dido, in her despair, they recur under
another aspect; she remembers their priestess as a great enchantress;
who <i>feeds the dragon</i> and preserves the boughs of the tree;
sprinkling moist honey and drowsy poppy; who also has power
over ghosts; &ldquo;and the earth shakes and the forests stoop from
the hills at her bidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 23. This passage Turner must have known well, from his
continual interest in Carthage: but his diminution of the splendor
of the old Greek garden was certainly caused chiefly by
Spenser&rsquo;s describing the Hesperides fruit as growing first in the
garden of Mammon:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>There are two collateral evidences in the picture of Turner&rsquo;s
mind having been partly influenced by this passage. The excessive
darkness of the stream,&mdash;though one of the Cyrene fountains&mdash;to
remind us of Cocytus; and the breaking of the bough
of the tree by the weight of its apples&mdash;not healthily, but as a
diseased tree would break.</p>

<p>§ 24. Such then is our English painter&rsquo;s first great religious
picture; and exponent of our English faith. A sad-colored
work, not executed in Angelico&rsquo;s white and gold; nor in Perugino&rsquo;s
crimson and azure; but in a sulphurous hue, as relating to
a paradise of smoke. That power, it appears, on the hill-top, is
our British Madonna; whom, reverently, the English devotional
painter must paint, thus enthroned, with nimbus about the gracious
head. Our Madonna,&mdash;or our Jupiter on Olympus,&mdash;or, perhaps
more accurately still, our unknown god, sea-born, with the
cliffs, not of Cyrene, but of England, for his altar; and no chance
of any Mars&rsquo; Hill proclamation concerning him, &ldquo;whom therefore
ye ignorantly worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 25. This is no irony. The fact is verily so. The greatest
man of our England, in the first half of the nineteenth century,
in the strength and hope of his youth, perceives this to be the
thing he has to tell us of utmost moment, connected with the
spiritual world. In each city and country of past time, the master-minds
had to declare the chief worship which lay at the
nation&rsquo;s heart; to define it; adorn it; show the range and authority
of it. Thus in Athens, we have the triumph of Pallas;
and in Venice the assumption of the Virgin; here, in England,
is our great spiritual fact for ever interpreted to us&mdash;the Assumption
of the Dragon. No St. George any more to be heard of;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
no more dragon-slaying possible: this child, born on St. George&rsquo;s
Day, can only make manifest the Dragon, not slay him, sea-serpent
as he is; whom the English Andromeda, not fearing, takes
for her lord. The fairy English Queen once thought to command
the waves, but it is the sea-dragon now who commands
her valleys; of old the Angel of the Sea ministered to them, but
now the Serpent of the Sea; where once flowed their clear
springs now spreads the black Cocytus pool; and the fair blooming
of the Hesperid meadows fades into ashes beneath the
Nereid&rsquo;s Guard.</p>

<p>Yes, Albert of Nuremberg; the time has at last come.
Another nation has arisen in the strength of its Black anger;
and another hand has portrayed the spirit of its toil. Crowned
with fire, and with the wings of the bat.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE HESPERID ÆGLÉ.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Five</span> years after the Hesperides were painted, another
great mythological subject appeared by Turner&rsquo;s hand. Another
dragon&mdash;this time not triumphant, but in death-pang; the
Python, slain by Apollo.</p>

<p>Not in a garden, this slaying, but in a hollow, among wildest
rocks, beside a stagnant pool. Yet, instead of the sombre coloring
of the Hesperid hills, strange gleams of blue and gold flit
around the mountain peaks, and color the clouds above them.</p>

<p>The picture is at once the type, and the first expression of a
great change which was passing in Turner&rsquo;s mind. A change,
which was not clearly manifested in all its results until much
later in his life; but in the coloring of this picture are the first
signs of it; and in the subject of this picture, its symbol.</p>

<p>§ 2. Had Turner died early, the reputation he would have
left, though great and enduring, would have been strangely different
from that which ultimately must now attach to his name.
He would have been remembered as one of the severest of
painters; his iron touch and positive form would have been continually
opposed to the delicacy of Claude and richness of Titian;
he would have been spoken of, popularly, as a man who had no
eye for color. Perhaps here and there a watchful critic might
have shown this popular idea to be false; but no conception
could have been formed by any one of the man&rsquo;s real disposition
or capacity.</p>

<p>It was only after the year 1820 that these were determinable,
and his peculiar work discerned.</p>

<p>§ 3. He had begun by faithful declaration of the sorrow there
was in the world. It is now permitted him to see also its beauty.
He becomes, separately and without rival, the painter of the
loveliness and light of the creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span></p>

<p>Of its loveliness: that which may be beloved in it, the tenderest,
kindest, most feminine of its aspects. Of its light: light
not merely diffused, but interpreted; light seen pre-eminently in
color.</p>

<p>Claude and Cuyp had painted the sun<i>shine</i>, Turner alone the
sun <i>color</i>.</p>

<p>Observe this accurately. Those easily understood effects of
afternoon light, gracious and sweet so far as they reach, are produced
by the softly warm or yellow rays of the sun falling
through mist. They are low in tone, even in nature, and disguise
the colors of objects. They are imitable even by persons
who have little or no gift of color, if the tones of the picture are
kept low and in true harmony, and the reflected lights warm.
But they never could be painted by great colorists. The fact of
blue and crimson being effaced by yellow and gray, puts such
effect at once out of the notice or thought of a colorist, unless
he has some special interest in the motive of it. You might as
well ask a musician to compose with only three notes, as Titian
to paint without crimson and blue. Accordingly the colorists in
general, feeling that no other than this yellow sunshine was imitable,
refused it, and painted in twilight, when the color was full.
Therefore, from the imperfect colorists,&mdash;from Cuyp, Claude,
Both, Wilson, we get deceptive effect of sunshine; never from
the Venetians, from Rubens, Reynolds or Velasquez. From
these we get only conventional substitutions for it, Rubens being
especially daring<a name="fa1ac" id="fa1ac" href="#ft1ac"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in frankness of symbol.</p>

<p>§ 4. Turner, however, as a landscape painter, had to represent
sunshine of one kind or another. He went steadily through
the subdued golden chord, and painted Cuyp&rsquo;s favorite effect,
&ldquo;sun rising through vapor,&rdquo; for many a weary year. But this
was not enough for him. He must paint the sun in his
strength, the sun rising <i>not</i> through vapor. If you glance at
that Apollo slaying the Python, you will see there is rose color
and blue on the clouds, as well as gold; and if then you turn
to the Apollo in the Ulysses and Polyphemus&mdash;his horses are
rising beyond the horizon,&mdash;you see he is not &ldquo;rising through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
vapor,&rdquo; but above it; gaining somewhat of a victory over vapor,
it appears.</p>

<p>The old Dutch brewer, with his yellow mist, was a great man
and a good guide, but he was not Apollo. He and his dray-horses
led the way through the flats, cheerily, for a little time;
we have other horses now flaming out &ldquo;beyond the mighty sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A victory over vapor of many kinds; Python-slaying in general.
Look how the Python&rsquo;s jaws smoke as he falls back
between the rocks:&mdash;a vaporous serpent! We will see who he
was, presently.</p>

<p>The public remonstrated loudly in the cause of Python: &ldquo;He
had been so yellow, quiet, and pleasant a creature; what meant
these azure-shafted arrows, this sudden glare into darkness, this
Iris message; Thaumantian;&mdash;miracle-working; scattering our
slumber down in Cocytus?&rdquo; It meant much, but that was not
what they should have first asked about it. They should have
asked simply, was it a true message? Were these Thaumantian
things so, in the real universe?</p>

<p>It might have been known easily they were. One fair dawn
or sunset, obediently beheld, would have set them right; and
shown that Turner was indeed the only true speaker concerning
such things that ever yet had appeared in the world. They
would neither look nor hear;&mdash;only shouted continuously, &ldquo;Perish
Apollo. Bring us back Python.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 5. We must understand the real meaning of this cry, for
herein rests not merely the question of the great right or wrong
in Turner&rsquo;s life, but the question of the right or wrong of all
painting. Nay, on this issue hangs the nobleness of painting as
an art altogether, for it is distinctively the art of coloring, not of
shaping or relating. Sculptors and poets can do these, the
painter&rsquo;s own work is color.</p>

<p>Thus, then, for the last time, rises the question, what is the
true dignity of color? We left that doubt a little while ago
among the clouds, wondering what they had been made so scarlet
for. Now Turner brings the doubt back to us, unescapable any
more. No man, hitherto, had painted the clouds scarlet. Hesperid
Æglé, and Erytheia, throned there in the west, fade into
the twilights of four thousand years, unconfessed. Here is at
last one who confesses them, but is it well? Men say these Hesperids
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
are sensual goddesses,&mdash;traitresses,&mdash;that the Graiæ are
the only true ones. Nature made the western and the eastern
clouds splendid in fallacy. Crimson is impure and vile; let us
paint in black if we would be virtuous.</p>

<p>§ 6. Note, with respect to this matter, that the peculiar innovation
of Turner was the perfection of the color chord by means
of <i>scarlet</i>. Other painters had rendered the golden tones, and
the blue tones, of sky; Titian especially the last, in perfectness.
But none had dared to paint, none seem to have seen, the scarlet
and purple.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in seeing this color in vividness when it occurred
in full light, that Turner differed from preceding painters.
His most distinctive innovation as a colorist was his discovery of
the scarlet <i>shadow</i>. &ldquo;True, there is a sunshine whose light is
golden, and its shadow gray; but there is another sunshine, and
that the purest, whose light is white, and its shadow scarlet.&rdquo;
This was the essentially offensive, inconceivable thing, which he
could not be believed in. There was some ground for the incredulity,
because no color is vivid enough to express the pitch
of light of pure white sunshine, so that the color given without
the true intensity of light <i>looks</i> false. Nevertheless, Turner
could not but report of the color truly. &ldquo;I must indeed be
lower in the key, but that is no reason why I should be false in
the note. Here is sunshine which glows even when subdued; it
has not cool shade, but fiery shade.&rdquo;<a name="fa2ac" id="fa2ac" href="#ft2ac"><span class="sp">2</span></a> This is the glory of sunshine.</p>

<p>§ 7. Now, this scarlet color,&mdash;or pure red, intensified by expression
of light,&mdash;is, of all the three primitive colors, that which
is most distinctive. Yellow is of the nature of simple light;
blue, connected with simple shade; but red is an entirely abstract
color. It is red to which the color-blind are blind, as if to show
us that it was not necessary merely for the service or comfort of
man, but that there was a special gift or teaching in this color.
Observe, farther, that it is this color which the sunbeams take in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
passing through the <i>earth&rsquo;s atmosphere</i>. The rose of dawn and
sunset is the hue of the rays passing close over the earth. It is
also concentrated in the blood of man.</p>

<p>§ 8. Unforeseen requirements have compelled me to disperse
through various works, undertaken between the first and last
portions of this essay, the examination of many points respecting
color, which I had intended to reserve for this place. I can now
only refer the reader to these several passages,<a name="fa3ac" id="fa3ac" href="#ft3ac"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and sum their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
import: which is briefly, that color generally, but chiefly the
scarlet, used with the hyssop, in the Levitical law, is the great
sanctifying element of visible beauty inseparably connected with
purity and life.</p>

<p>I must not enter here into the solemn and far-reaching fields
of thought which it would be necessary to traverse, in order to
detect the mystical connection between life and love, set forth in
that Hebrew system of sacrificial religion to which we may trace
most of the received ideas respecting sanctity, consecration, and

purification. This only I must hint to the reader&mdash;for his own

from which our heedless popular language respecting the washing
away of sins has been borrowed, he will find that the fountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
in which sins are indeed to be washed away, is that of love, not
of agony.</p>

<p>§ 9. But, without approaching the presence of this deeper
meaning of the sign, the reader may rest satisfied with the connection
given him directly in written words, between the cloud
and its bow. The cloud, or firmament, as we have seen, signifies
the ministration of the heavens to man. That ministration
may be in judgment or mercy&mdash;in the lightning, or the dew.
But the bow, or color, of the cloud, signifies always mercy, the
sparing of life; such ministry of the heaven, as shall feed and
prolong life. And as the sunlight, undivided, is the type of the
wisdom and righteousness of God, so divided, and softened into
color by means of the fundamental ministry, fitted to every need
of man, as to every delight, and becoming one chief source of
human beauty, by being made part of the flesh of man;&mdash;thus
divided, the sunlight is the type of the wisdom of God, becoming
sanctification and redemption. Various in work&mdash;various in
beauty&mdash;various in power.</p>

<p>Color is, therefore, in brief terms, the type of love. Hence
it is especially connected with the blossoming of the earth; and
again, with its fruits; also, with the spring and fall of the leaf,
and with the morning and evening of the day, in order to show
the waiting of love about the birth and death of man.</p>

<p>§ 10. And now, I think, we may understand, even far away
in the Greek mind, the meaning of that contest of Apollo with
the Python. It was a far greater contest than that of Hercules
with Ladon. Fraud and avarice might be overcome by frankness
and force; but this Python was a darker enemy, and could
not be subdued but by a greater god. Nor was the conquest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
slightly esteemed by the victor deity. He took his great name
from it thenceforth&mdash;his prophetic and sacred name&mdash;the Pythian.</p>

<p>It could, therefore, be no merely devouring dragon&mdash;no mere
wild beast with scales and claws. It must possess some more
terrible character to make conquest over it so glorious. Consider
the meaning of its name, &ldquo;<span class="scs">THE CORRUPTER.</span>&rdquo; That Hesperid
dragon was a treasure-guardian. This is the treasure-destroyer,&mdash;where
moth and rust doth corrupt&mdash;the worm of eternal
decay.</p>

<p>Apollo&rsquo;s contest with him is the strife of purity with pollution;
of life, with forgetfulness; of love, with the grave.</p>

<p>§ 11. I believe this great battle stood, in the Greek mind,
for the type of the struggle of youth and manhood with deadly
sin&mdash;venomous, infectious, irrecoverable sin. In virtue of his
victory over this corruption, Apollo becomes thenceforward the
guide; the witness; the purifying and helpful God. The other
gods help waywardly, whom they choose. But Apollo helps
always: he is by name, not only Pythian, the conqueror of
death; but Pæan&mdash;the healer of the people.</p>

<p>Well did Turner know the meaning of that battle: he has
told its tale with fearful distinctness. The Mammon dragon
was armed with adamant; but this dragon of decay is a mere
colossal worm: wounded, he bursts asunder in the midst,<a name="fa4ac" id="fa4ac" href="#ft4ac"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and
melts to pieces, rather than dies, vomiting smoke&mdash;a smaller
serpent-worm rising out of his blood.</p>

<p>§ 12. Alas, for Turner! This smaller serpent-worm, it
seemed, he could not conceive to be slain. In the midst of all
the power and beauty of nature, he still saw this death-worm
writhing among the weeds. A little thing now, yet enough;
you may see it in the foreground of the Bay of Baiæ, which has
also in it the story of Apollo and the Sibyl; Apollo giving love;
but not youth, nor immortality: you may see it again in the
foreground of the Lake Avernus&mdash;the Hades lake&mdash;which Turner
surrounds with delicatest beauty, the Fates dancing in circle;
but in front, is the serpent beneath the thistle and the wild
thorn. The same Sibyl, Deiphobe, holding the golden bough. I
cannot get at the meaning of this legend of the bough; but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
was, assuredly, still connected, in Turner&rsquo;s mind, with that help
from Apollo. He indicated the strength of his feeling at the
time when he painted the Python contest, by the drawing exhibited
the same year, of the Prayer of Chryses. There the
priest is on the beach alone, the sun setting. He prays to it as
it descends;&mdash;flakes of its sheeted light are borne to him by the
melancholy waves, and cast away with sighs upon the sand.</p>

<p>How this sadness came to be persistent over Turner, and
to conquer him, we shall see in a little while. It is enough for
us to know at present that our most wise and Christian England,
with all her appurtenances of school-porch and church-spire,
had so disposed her teaching as to leave this somewhat
notable child of hers without even cruel Pandora&rsquo;s gift.</p>

<p>He was without hope.</p>

<p>True daughter of Night, Hesperid Æglé was to him; coming
between Censure, and Sorrow,&mdash;and the Destinies.</p>

<p>§ 13. What, for us, his work yet may be, I know not. But
let not the real nature of it be misunderstood any more.</p>

<p>He is distinctively, as he rises into his own peculiar strength,
separating himself from all men who had painted forms of the
physical world before,&mdash;the painter of the loveliness of nature,
with the worm at its root: Rose and cankerworm,&mdash;both with
his utmost strength; the one <i>never</i> separate from the other.</p>

<p>In which his work was the true image of his own mind.</p>

<p>I would fain have looked last at the rose; but that is not the
way Atropos will have it, and there is no pleading with her.</p>

<p>So, therefore, first of the rose.</p>

<p>§ 14. That is to say, of this vision of the loveliness and kindness
of Nature, as distinguished from all visions of her ever received
by other men. By the Greek, she had been distrusted.
She was to him Calypso, the Concealer, Circe, the Sorceress. By
the Venetian, she had been dreaded. Her wildernesses were
desolate; her shadows stern. By the Fleming, she had been
despised; what mattered the heavenly colors to him? But at
last, the time comes for her loveliness and kindness to be declared
to men. Had they helped Turner, listened to him, believed
in him, he had done it wholly for them. But they cried
out for Python, and Python came;&mdash;came literally as well as
spiritually;&mdash;all the perfectest beauty and conquest which Turner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
wrought is already withered. The cankerworm stood at his
right hand, and of all his richest, most precious work, there remains
only the shadow. Yet that shadow is more than other
men&rsquo;s sunlight; it is the scarlet shade, shade of the Rose.
Wrecked, and faded, and defiled, his work still, in what remains
of it, or may remain, is the loveliest ever yet done by man, in
imagery of the physical world. Whatsoever is there of fairest,
you will find recorded by Turner, and by him alone.</p>

<p>§ 15. I say <i>you</i> will find, not knowing to how few I speak;
for in order to find what is fairest, you must delight in what is
fair; and I know not how few or how many there may be who
take such delight. Once I could speak joyfully about beautiful
things, thinking to be understood;&mdash;now I cannot any more;
for it seems to me that no one regards them. Wherever I look
or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they
can reach, destroy all beauty. They seem to have no other desire
or hope but to have large houses and to be able to move fast.
Every perfect and lovely spot which they can touch, they defile.<a name="fa5ac" id="fa5ac" href="#ft5ac"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>§ 16. Nevertheless, though not joyfully, or with any hope of
being at present heard, I would have tried to enter here into
some examination of the right and worthy effect of beauty in
Art upon human mind, if I had been myself able to come to
demonstrable conclusions. But the question is so complicated
with that of the enervating influence of all luxury, that I cannot
get it put into any tractable compass. Nay, I have many
inquiries to make, many difficult passages of history to examine,
before I can determine the just limits of the hope in which I
may permit myself to continue to labor in any cause of Art.</p>

<p>Nor is the subject connected with the purpose of this book.
I have written it to show that Turner is the greatest landscape
painter who ever lived; and this it has sufficiently accomplished.
What the final use may be to men, of landscape painting, or of
any painting, or of natural beauty, I do not yet know. Thus
far, however, I <i>do</i> know.</p>

<p>§ 17. Three principal forms of asceticism have existed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
this weak world. Religious asceticism, being the refusal of
pleasure and knowledge for the sake (as supposed) of religion;
seen chiefly in the middle ages. Military asceticism, being the
refusal of pleasure and knowledge for the sake of power; seen
chiefly in the early days of Sparta and Rome. And monetary
asceticism, consisting in the refusal of pleasure and knowledge
for the sake of money; seen in the present days of London and
Manchester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not come here to look at the mountains,&rdquo; said the
Carthusian to me at the Grande Chartreuse. &ldquo;We do not come
here to look at the mountains,&rdquo; the Austrian generals would
say, encamping by the shores of Garda. &ldquo;We do not come here
to look at the mountains,&rdquo; so the thriving manufacturers tell
me, between Rochdale and Halifax.</p>

<p>§ 18. All these asceticisms have their bright, and their dark
sides. I myself like the military asceticism best, because it is
not so necessarily a refusal of general knowledge as the two
others, but leads to acute and marvellous use of mind, and perfect
use of body. Nevertheless, none of the three are a healthy
or central state of man. There is much to be respected in each,
but they are not what we should wish large numbers of men to
become. A monk of La Trappe, a French soldier of the Imperial
Guard, and a thriving mill-owner, supposing each a type,
and no more than a type, of his class, are all interesting specimens
of humanity, but narrow ones,&mdash;so narrow that even all
the three together would not make a perfect man. Nor does it
appear in any way desirable that either of the three classes
should extend itself so as to include a majority of the persons in
the world, and turn large cities into mere groups of monastery,
barracks, or factory. I do not say that it may not be desirable
that one city, or one country, sacrificed for the good of the rest,
should become a mass of barracks or factories. Perhaps, it may
be well that this England should become the furnace of the
world; so that the smoke of the island, rising out of the sea,
should be seen from a hundred leagues away, as if it were a field
of fierce volcanoes; and every kind of sordid, foul, or venomous
work which in other countries men dreaded or disdained,
it should become England&rsquo;s duty to do,&mdash;becoming thus the off-scourer
of the earth, and taking the hyena instead of the lion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
upon her shield. I do not, for a moment, deny this; but, looking
broadly, not at the destiny of England, nor of any country
in particular, but of the world, this is certain&mdash;that men exclusively
occupied either in spiritual reverie, mechanical destruction,
or mechanical productiveness, fall below the proper standard
of their race, and enter into a lower form of being; and
that the true perfection of the race, and, therefore, its power
and happiness, are only to be attained by a life which is neither
speculative nor productive; but essentially contemplative and
protective, which (A) does not lose itself in the monk&rsquo;s vision or
hope, but delights in seeing present and real things as they truly
are; which (B) does not mortify itself for the sake of obtaining
powers of destruction, but seeks the more easily attainable
powers of affection, observance, and protection; which (C),
finally, does not mortify itself with a view to productive accumulation,
but delights itself in peace, with its appointed portion.
So that the things to be desired for man in a healthy
state, are that he should not see dreams, but realities; that he
should not destroy life, but save it; and that he should be not
rich, but content.</p>

<p>§ 19. Towards which last state of contentment, I do not see
that the world is at present approximating. There are, indeed,
two forms of discontent: one laborious, the other indolent and
complaining. We respect the man of laborious desire, but let
us not suppose that his restlessness is peace, or his ambition
meekness. It is because of the special connection of meekness
with contentment that it is promised that the meek shall &ldquo;inherit
the earth.&rdquo; Neither covetous men, nor the Grave, can inherit
anything;<a name="fa6ac" id="fa6ac" href="#ft6ac"><span class="sp">6</span></a> they can but consume. Only contentment can
possess.</p>

<p>§ 20. The most helpful and sacred work, therefore, which
can at present be done for humanity, is to teach people (chiefly
by example, as all best teaching must be done) not how &ldquo;to better
themselves,&rdquo; but how to &ldquo;satisfy themselves.&rdquo; It is the curse
of every evil nation and evil creature to eat, and <i>not</i> be satisfied.
The words of blessing are, that they shall eat and be satisfied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
And as there is only one kind of water which quenches all thirst,
so there is only one kind of bread which satisfies all hunger, the
bread of justice or righteousness; which hungering after, men
shall always be filled, that being the bread of Heaven; but hungering
after the bread, or wages, of unrighteousness, shall not
be filled, that being the bread of Sodom.</p>

<p>§ 21. And, in order to teach men how to be satisfied, it is
necessary fully to understand the art and joy of humble life,&mdash;this,
at present, of all arts or sciences being the one most needing
study. Humble life&mdash;that is to say, proposing to itself no
future exaltation, but only a sweet continuance; not excluding
the idea of foresight, but wholly of fore-sorrow, and taking no
troublous thought for coming days: so, also, not excluding the
idea of providence, or provision,<a name="fa7ac" id="fa7ac" href="#ft7ac"><span class="sp">7</span></a> but wholly of accumulation;&mdash;the
life of domestic affection and domestic peace, full of sensitiveness
to all elements of costless and kind pleasure;&mdash;therefore,
chiefly to the loveliness of the natural world.</p>

<p>§ 22. What length and severity of labor may be ultimately
found necessary for the procuring of the due comforts of life, I
do not know; neither what degree of refinement it is possible to
unite with the so-called servile occupations of life: but this I
know, that right economy of labor will, as it is understood, assign
to each man as much as will be healthy for him, and no
more; and that no refinements are desirable which cannot be
connected with toil.</p>

<p>I say, first, that due economy of labor will assign to each
man the share which is right. Let no technical labor be wasted
on things useless or unpleasurable;<a name="fa8ac" id="fa8ac" href="#ft8ac"><span class="sp">8</span></a> and let all physical exertion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
so far as possible, be utilized, and it will be found no man
need ever work more than is good for him. I believe an immense
gain in the bodily health and happiness of the upper
classes would follow on their steadily endeavoring, however
clumsily, to make the physical exertion they now necessarily
take in amusements, definitely serviceable. It would be far better,
for instance, that a gentleman should mow his own fields,
than ride over other people&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>§ 23. Again, respecting degrees of possible refinement, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
cannot yet speak positively, because no effort has yet been made
to teach refined habits to persons of simple life.</p>

<p>The idea of such refinement has been made to appear absurd,
partly by the foolish ambition of vulgar persons in low life, but
more by the worse than foolish assumption, acted on so often by
modern advocates of improvement, that &ldquo;education&rdquo; means
teaching Latin, or algebra, or music, or drawing, instead of
developing or &ldquo;drawing out&rdquo; the human soul.</p>

<p>It may not be the least necessary that a peasant should know
algebra, or Greek, or drawing. But it may, perhaps, be both
possible and expedient that he should be able to arrange his
thoughts clearly, to speak his own language intelligibly, to discern
between right and wrong, to govern his passions, and to
receive such pleasures of ear or sight as his life may render
accessible to him. I would not have him taught the science of
music; but most assuredly I would have him taught to sing. I
would not teach him the science of drawing; but certainly I
would teach him to see; without learning a single term of
botany, he should know accurately the habits and uses of every
leaf and flower in his fields; and unencumbered by any theories
of moral or political philosophy, he should help his neighbor,
and disdain a bribe.</p>

<p>§ 24. Many most valuable conclusions respecting the degree
of nobleness and refinement which may be attained in servile or
in rural life may be arrived at by a careful study of the noble
writings of Blitzius (Jeremias Gotthelf), which contain a record
of Swiss character not less valuable in its fine truth than that
which Scott has left of the Scottish. I know no ideal characters
of women, whatever their station, more majestic than that of
Freneli (in Ulric le Valet de Ferme, and Ulric le Fermier); or
of Elise, in the Tour de Jacob; nor any more exquisitely tender
and refined than that of Aenneli in the Fromagerie and Aenneli
in the Miroir des Paysans.<a name="fa9ac" id="fa9ac" href="#ft9ac"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>§ 25. How far this simple and useful pride, this delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
innocence, might be adorned, or how far destroyed, by higher
intellectual education in letters or the arts, cannot be known
without other experience than the charity of men has hitherto
enabled us to acquire.</p>

<p>All effort in social improvement is paralyzed, because no one
has been bold or clear-sighted enough to put and press home
this radical question: &ldquo;What is indeed the noblest tone and
reach of life for men; and how can the possibility of it be extended
to the greatest numbers?&rdquo; It is answered, broadly and
rashly, that wealth is good; that knowledge is good; that art is
good; that luxury is good. Whereas none of them are good in
the abstract, but good only if rightly received. Nor have any
steps whatever been yet securely taken,&mdash;nor, otherwise than in
the resultless rhapsody of moralists,&mdash;to ascertain what luxuries
and what learning it is either kind to bestow, or wise to desire.
This, however, at least we know, shown clearly by the history
of all time, that the arts and sciences, ministering to the pride
of nations, have invariably hastened their ruin; and this, also,
without venturing to say that I know, I nevertheless firmly believe,
that the same arts and sciences will tend as distinctly to
exalt the strength and quicken the soul of every nation which
employs them to increase the comfort of lowly life, and grace
with happy intelligence the unambitious courses of honorable
toil.</p>

<p>Thus far, then, of the Rose.</p>

<p>§ 26. Last, of the Worm.</p>

<p>I said that Turner painted the labor of men, their sorrow,
and their death. This he did nearly in the same tones of mind
which prompted Byron&rsquo;s poem of Childe Harold, and the loveliest
result of his art, in the central period of it, was an effort to
express on a single canvas the meaning of that poem. It may
be now seen, by strange coincidence, associated with two others&mdash;Caligula&rsquo;s
Bridge and the Apollo and Sibyl; the one illustrative
of the vanity of human labor, the other of the vanity of human
life.<a name="fa10ac" id="fa10ac" href="#ft10ac"><span class="sp">10</span></a> He painted these, as I said, in the same tone of mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
which formed the Childe Harold poem, but with different
capacity: Turner&rsquo;s sense of beauty was perfect; deeper, therefore,
far than Byron&rsquo;s; only that of Keats and Tennyson being
comparable with it. And Turner&rsquo;s love of truth was as stern
and patient as Dante&rsquo;s; so that when over these great capacities
come the shadows of despair, the wreck is infinitely sterner and
more sorrowful. With no sweet home for his childhood,&mdash;friendless
in youth,&mdash;loveless in manhood,&mdash;and hopeless in
death, Turner was what Dante might have been, without the
&ldquo;bello ovile,&rdquo; without Casella, without Beatrice, and without
Him who gave them all, and took them all away.</p>

<p>§ 27. I will trace this state of his mind farther, in a little
while. Meantime, I want you to note only the result upon his
work;&mdash;how, through all the remainder of his life, wherever he
looked, he saw ruin.</p>

<p>Ruin, and twilight. What was the distinctive effect of light
which he introduced, such as no man had painted before?
Brightness, indeed, he gave, as we have seen, because it was
true and right; but in this he only perfected what others had
attempted. His own favorite light is not Æglé, but Hesperid
Æglé. Fading of the last rays of sunset. Faint breathing of
the sorrow of night.</p>

<p>§ 28. And fading of sunset, note also, on ruin. I cannot
but wonder that this difference between Turner&rsquo;s work and
previous art-conception has not been more observed. None of
the great early painters draw ruins, except compulsorily. The
shattered buildings introduced by them are shattered artificially,
like models. There is no real sense of decay; whereas Turner
only momentarily dwells on anything else than ruin. Take up
the Liber Studiorum, and observe how this feeling of decay and
humiliation gives solemnity to all its simplest subjects; even to
his view of daily labor. I have marked its tendency in examining
the design of the Mill and Lock, but observe its continuance
through the book. There is no exultation in thriving city,
or mart, or in happy rural toil, or harvest gathering. Only the
grinding at the mill, and patient striving with hard conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
of life. Observe the two disordered and poor farm-yards, cart,
and ploughshare, and harrow rotting away; note the pastoral
by the brook side, with its neglected stream, and haggard trees,
and bridge with the broken rail, and decrepit children&mdash;fever-struck&mdash;one
sitting stupidly by the stagnant stream; the other
in rags, and with an old man&rsquo;s hat on, and lame, leaning on a
stick. Then the &ldquo;Hedging and ditching,&rdquo; with its bleak sky
and blighted trees&mdash;hacked, and bitten, and starved by the clay
soil into something between trees and firewood; its meanly-faced,
sickly laborers&mdash;pollard laborers, like the willow trunk
they hew; and the slatternly peasant-woman, with worn cloak
and battered bonnet&mdash;an English Dryad. Then the Water-mill,
beyond the fallen steps overgrown with the thistle: itself
a ruin, mud-built at first, now propped on both sides;&mdash;the
planks torn from its cattle-shed; a feeble beam, splintered at
the end, set against the dwelling-house from the ruined pier of
the watercourse; the old millstone&mdash;useless for many a day&mdash;half
buried in slime, at the bottom of the wall; the listless children,
listless dog, and the poor gleaner bringing her single sheaf
to be ground. Then the &ldquo;Peat bog,&rdquo; with its cold, dark rain,
and dangerous labor. And last and chief, the mill in the valley
of the Chartreuse. Another than Turner would have painted
the convent; but he had no sympathy with the hope, no mercy
for the indolence of the monk. He painted the mill in the
valley. Precipice overhanging it, and wildness of dark forest
round; blind rage and strength of mountain torrent rolled beneath
it,&mdash;calm sunset above, but fading from the glen, leaving
it to its roar of passionate waters and sighing of pine-branches
in the night.</p>

<p>§ 29. Such is his view of human labor. Of human pride,
see what records. Morpeth tower, roofless and black; gate of
old Winchelsea wall, the flock of sheep driven <i>round</i> it, not
through it; and Rievaulx choir, and Kirkstall crypt; and
Dunstanborough, wan above the sea; and Chepstow, with
arrowy light through traceried windows; and Lindisfarne, with
failing height of wasted shaft and wall; and last and sweetest,
Raglan, in utter solitude, amidst the wild wood of its own pleasance;
the towers rounded with ivy, and the forest roots choked
with undergrowth, and the brook languid amidst lilies and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
sedges. Legends of gray knights and enchanted ladies keeping
the woodman&rsquo;s children away at the sunset.</p>

<p>These are his types of human pride. Of human love: Procris,
dying by the arrow; Hesperie, by the viper&rsquo;s fang; and
Rizpah, more than dead, beside her children.</p>

<p>§ 30. Such are the lessons of the Liber Studiorum. Silent
always with a bitter silence, disdaining to tell his meaning,
when he saw there was no ear to receive it, Turner only indicated
this purpose by slight words of contemptuous anger, when
he heard of any one&rsquo;s trying to obtain this or the other separate
subject as more beautiful than the rest. &ldquo;What is the use of
them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but together?&rdquo;<a name="fa11ac" id="fa11ac" href="#ft11ac"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The meaning of the entire
book was symbolized in the frontispiece, which he engraved with
his own hand: Tyre at sunset, with the Rape of Europa, indicating
the symbolism of the decay of Europe by that of Tyre, its
beauty passing away into terror and judgment (Europa being
the mother of Minos and Rhadamanthus).<a name="fa12ac" id="fa12ac" href="#ft12ac"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>§ 31. I need not trace the dark clue farther, the reader may
follow it unbroken through all his work and life, this thread of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
Atropos.<a name="fa13ac" id="fa13ac" href="#ft13ac"><span class="sp">13</span></a> I will only point, in conclusion, to the intensity
with which his imagination dwelt always on the three great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
cities of Carthage, Rome, and Venice&mdash;Carthage in connection
especially with the thoughts and study which led to the painting
of the Hesperides&rsquo; Garden, showing the death which attends
the vain pursuit of wealth; Rome, showing the death which attends
the vain pursuit of power; Venice, the death which attends
the vain pursuit of beauty.</p>

<p>How strangely significative, thus understood, those last
Venetian dreams of his become, themselves so beautiful and so
frail; wrecks of all that they were once&mdash;twilights of twilight!</p>

<p>§ 32. Vain beauty; yet not all in vain. Unlike in birth,
how like in their labor, and their power over the future, these
masters of England and Venice&mdash;Turner and Giorgione. But
ten years ago, I saw the last traces of the greatest works of
Giorgione yet glowing, like a scarlet cloud, on the Fondaco de
Tedeschi.<a name="fa14ac" id="fa14ac" href="#ft14ac"><span class="sp">14</span></a> And though that scarlet cloud (sanguigna e fiammeggiante,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>

of night, and Venice herself waste from her islands as a wreath
of wind-driven foam fades from their weedy beach;&mdash;that which

<p><a name="ft1ac" id="ft1ac" href="#fa1ac"><span class="fn">1</span></a> There is a very wonderful, and almost deceptive, imitation of sunlight
by Rubens at Berlin. It falls through broken clouds upon angels, the flesh
being chequered with sunlight and shade.</p>

<p><a name="ft2ac" id="ft2ac" href="#fa2ac"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Not, accurately speaking, shadow, but dark side. All shadow proper
is negative in color, but, generally, reflected light is warmer than direct
light; and when the direct light is warm, pure, and of the highest intensity,
its reflection is scarlet. Turner habitually, in his later sketches, used vermilion
for his pen outline in effects of sun.</p>

<p><a name="ft3ac" id="ft3ac" href="#fa3ac"><span class="fn">3</span></a> The following collected system of the various statements made respecting
color in different parts of my works may be useful to the student:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Abstract color is of far less importance than abstract form (vol. i.
chap. v.); that is to say, if it could rest in our choice whether we would
carve like Phidias (supposing Phidias had never used color), or arrange
the colors of a shawl like Indians, there is no question as to which power
we ought to choose. The difference of rank is vast; there is no way of estimating
or measuring it.</p>

<p>So, again, if it rest in our choice whether we will be great in invention of
form, to be expressed only by light and shade, as Durer, or great in invention
and application of color, caring only for ungainly form, as Bassano,
there is still no question. Try to be Durer, of the two. So again, if we have
to give an account or description of anything&mdash;if it be an object of high interest&mdash;its
form will be always what we should first tell. Neither leopard
spots nor partridge&rsquo;s signify primarily in describing either beast or bird. But
teeth and feathers do.</p>

<p>2. Secondly. Though color is of less importance than form, if you introduce
it at all, it must be right.</p>

<p>People often speak of the Roman school as if it were greater than the
Venetian, because its color is &ldquo;subordinate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Its color is not subordinate. It is <span class="scs">BAD</span>.</p>

<p>If you paint colored objects, you must either paint them rightly or
wrongly. There is no other choice. You may introduce as little color as
you choose&mdash;a mere tint of rose in a chalk drawing, for instance; or pale
hues generally&mdash;as Michael Angelo in the Sistine Chapel. All such work
implies feebleness or imperfection, but not necessarily error. But if you
paint with full color, as Raphael and Leonardo, you must either be true or
false. If true, you will paint like a Venetian. If false, your form, supremely
beautiful, may draw the attention of the spectator from the false color, or
induce him to pardon it&mdash;and, if ill-taught, even to like it; but your picture
is none the greater for that. Had Leonardo and Raphael colored like Giorgione,
their work would have been greater, not less, than it is now.</p>

<p>3. To color perfectly is the rarest and most precious (technical) power an
artist can possess. There have been only seven supreme colorists among the
true painters whose works exist (namely, Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, Tintoret,
Correggio, Reynolds, and Turner); but the names of great designers,
including sculptors, architects, and metal-workers, are multitudinous. Also,
if you can color perfectly, you are sure to be able to do everything else if you
like. There never yet was colorist who could not draw; but faculty of perceiving
form may exist alone. I believe, however, it will be found ultimately
that the <i>perfect</i> gifts of color and form always go together. Titian&rsquo;s form is
nobler than Durer&rsquo;s, and more subtle; nor have I any doubt but that Phidias
could have painted as nobly as he carved. But when the powers are not
supreme, the wisest men usually neglect the color-gift, and develope that of
form.</p>

<p>I have not thought it worth while at present to enter into any examination
of the construction of Turner&rsquo;s color system, because the public is at
present so unconscious of the meaning and nature of color that they would
not know what I was talking of. The more than ludicrous folly of the
system of modern water-color painting, in which it is assumed that every
hue in the drawing may be beneficially washed into every other, must prevent,
as long as it influences the popular mind, even incipient inquiry respecting
color-art. But for help of any solitary and painstaking student, it
may be noted that Turner&rsquo;s color is founded more on Correggio and Bassano
than on the central Venetians; it involves a more tender and constant reference
to light and shade than that of Veronese; and a more sparkling and
gem-like lustre than that of Titian. I dislike using a technical word which
has been disgraced by affectation, but there is no other word to signify what
I mean in saying that Turner&rsquo;s color has, to the full, Correggio&rsquo;s &ldquo;morbidezza,&rdquo;
including also, in due place, conditions of mosaic effect, like that of
the colors in an Indian design, unaccomplished by any previous master in
painting; and a fantasy of inventive arrangement corresponding to that of
Beethoven in music. In its concurrence with and expression of texture or
construction of surfaces (as their bloom, lustre, or intricacy) it stands unrivalled&mdash;no
still-life painting by any other master can stand for an instant
beside Turner&rsquo;s, when his work is of life-size, as in his numerous studies of
birds and their plumage. This &ldquo;morbidezza&rdquo; of color is associated, precisely
as it was in Correggio, with an exquisite sensibility to fineness and
intricacy of curvature: curvature, as already noticed in the second volume,
being to lines what gradation is to colors. This subject, also, is too difficult
and too little regarded by the public, to be entered upon here, but it must
be observed that this quality of Turner&rsquo;s design, the one which of all is best
expressible by engraving, has of all been least expressed, owing to the constant
reduction or change of proportion in the plates. Publishers, of course,
require generally their plates to be of one size (the plates in this book form
an appalling exception to received practice in this respect); Turner always
made his drawings longer or shorter by half an inch, or more, according to
the subject; the engravers contracted or expanded them to fit the books,
with utter destruction of the nature of every curve in the design. Mere
reduction necessarily involves such loss to some extent; but the degree in
which it probably involves it has been curiously exemplified by the 61st
Plate in this volume, reduced from a
pen-drawing of mine, 18 inches long.
Fig. 101 is a facsimile of the hook and
piece of drapery, in the foreground, in
my drawing, which is very nearly true
to the Turner curves: compare them
with the curves either in Plate 61, or
in the published engraving in the England
series. The Plate opposite (80) is a portion of the foreground of the
drawing of the Llanberis (England Series), also of its real size; and interesting
as showing the grace of Turner&rsquo;s curvature even when he was drawing
fastest. It is a hasty drawing throughout, and after finishing the rocks and
water, being apparently a little tired, he has struck out the broken fence of
the watering-place for the cattle with a few impetuous dashes of the hand.
Yet the curvature and grouping of line are still perfectly tender. How far
the passage loses by reduction, may be seen by a glance at the published
engraving.</p>

<p>4. Color, as stated in the text, is the purifying or sanctifying element of
material beauty.</p>

<p>If so, how less important than form? Because, on form depends existence;
on color, only purity. Under the Levitical law, neither scarlet nor
hyssop could purify the deformed. So, under all natural law, there must be
rightly shaped members first; then sanctifying color and fire in them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are several great difficulties and oppositions of aspect
in this matter, which I must try to reconcile now clearly and finally. As
color is the type of Love, it resembles it in all its modes of operation; and
in practical work of human hands, it sustains changes of worthiness precisely
like those of human sexual love. That love, when true, faithful,
well-fixed, is eminently the sanctifying element of human life: without it,
the soul cannot reach its fullest height of holiness. But if shallow, faithless,
misdirected, it is also one of the strongest corrupting and degrading elements
of life.</p>

<p>Between these base and lofty states of Love are the loveless states; some
cold and horrible; others chaste, childish, or ascetic, bearing to careless
thinkers the semblance of purity higher than that of Love.</p>

<p>So it is with the type of Love&mdash;color. Followed rashly, coarsely, untruly,
for the mere pleasure of it, with no reverence, it becomes a temptation, and
leads to corruption. Followed faithfully, with intense but reverent passion,
it is the holiest of all aspects of material things.</p>

<p>Between these two modes of pursuing it, come two modes of refusing it&mdash;one,
dark and sensual; the other, statuesque and grave, having great aspect
of nobleness.</p>

<p>Thus we have, first, the coarse love of color, as a vulgar person&rsquo;s choice
of gaudy hues in dress.</p>

<p>Then, again, we have the base disdain of color, of which I have spoken
at length elsewhere. Thus we have the lofty disdain of color, as in Durer&rsquo;s
and Raphael&rsquo;s drawing: finally, the severest and passionate following of it,
in Giorgione and Titian.</p>

<p>5. Color is, more than all elements of art, the reward of veracity of
purpose. This point respecting it I have not noticed before, and it is
highly curious. We have just seen that in giving an account of anything
for its own sake, the most important points are those of form. Nevertheless,
the form of the object is its own attribute; special, not shared with
other things. An error in giving an account of it does not necessarily involve
wider error.</p>

<p>But its color is partly its own, partly shared with other things round it.
The hue and power of all broad sunlight is involved in the color it has cast
upon this single thing; to falsify that color, is to misrepresent and break the
harmony of the day: also, by what color it bears, this single object is altering
hues all round it; reflecting its own into them, displaying them by opposition,
softening them by repetition; one falsehood in color in one place,
implies a thousand in the neighborhood. Hence, there are peculiar penalties
attached to falsehood in color, and peculiar rewards granted to veracity in it.
Form may be attained in perfectness by painters who, in their course of study,
are continually altering or idealizing it; but only the sternest fidelity will
reach coloring. Idealize or alter in that, and you are lost. Whether you
alter by abasing, or exaggerating,&mdash;by glare or by decline, one fate is for
you&mdash;ruin. Violate truth wilfully in the slightest particular, or, at least,
get into the habit of violating it, and all kinds of failure and error will surround
and haunt you to your fall.</p>

<p>Therefore, also, as long as you are working with form only, you may
amuse yourself with fancies; but color is sacred&mdash;in that you must keep to
facts. Hence the apparent anomaly that the only schools of color are the
schools of Realism. The men who care for form only, may drift about in
dreams of Spiritualism; but a colorist must keep to substance. The greater
his power in color enchantment, the more stern and constant will be his
common sense. Fuseli may wander wildly among gray spectra, but Reynolds
and Gainsborough must stay in broad daylight, with pure humanity.
Velasquez, the greatest colorist, is the most accurate portrait painter of
Spain; Holbein, the most accurate portrait painter, is the only colorist of
Germany; and even Tintoret had to sacrifice some of the highest qualities
of his color before he could give way to the flights of wayward though
mighty imagination, in which his mind rises or declines from the royal calm
of Titian.</p>

<p><a name="ft4ac" id="ft4ac" href="#fa4ac"><span class="fn">4</span></a> Compare the deaths of Jehoram, Herod, and Judas.</p>

<p><a name="ft5ac" id="ft5ac" href="#fa5ac"><span class="fn">5</span></a> Thus, the railroad bridge over the Fall of Schaffhausen, and that round
the Clarens shore of the lake of Geneva, have destroyed the power of two
pieces of scenery of which nothing can ever supply the place, in appeal to
the higher ranks of European mind.</p>

<p><a name="ft6ac" id="ft6ac" href="#fa6ac"><span class="fn">6</span></a> &ldquo;There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say
not, it is enough: the grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not
filled with water; and the fire, that saith not, It is enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft7ac" id="ft7ac" href="#fa7ac"><span class="fn">7</span></a> A bad word, being only &ldquo;foresight&rdquo; again in Latin; but we have no
other good English word for the sense into which it has been warped.</p>

<p><a name="ft8ac" id="ft8ac" href="#fa8ac"><span class="fn">8</span></a> I cannot repeat too often (for it seems almost impossible to arouse the
public mind in the least to a sense of the fact) that the root of all benevolent
and helpful action towards the lower classes consists in the wise direction
of purchase; that is to say, in spending money, as far as possible, only
for products of healthful and natural labor. All work with fire is more or
less harmful and degrading; so also mine, or machine labor. They at
present develope more intelligence than rural labor, but this is only because
no education, properly so called, being given to the lower classes, those
occupations are best for them which compel them to attain some accurate
knowledge, discipline them in presence of mind, and bring them within
spheres in which they may raise themselves to positions of command.
Properly taught, a ploughman ought to be more intelligent, as well as more
healthy, than a miner.</p>

<p>Every nation which desires to ennoble itself should endeavor to maintain
as large a number of persons as possible by rural and maritime labor (including
fishing). I cannot in this place enter into consideration of the
relative advantages of different channels of industry. Any one who sincerely
desires to act upon such knowledge will find no difficulty in obtaining
it.</p>

<p>I have also several series of experiments and inquiries to undertake before
I shall be able to speak with security on certain points connected with
education; but I have no doubt that every child in a civilized country
should be taught the first principles of natural history, physiology, and
medicine; also to sing perfectly, so far as it has capacity, and to draw any
definite form accurately to any scale.</p>

<p>These things it should be taught by requiring its attendance at school
not more than three hours a day, and less if possible (the best part of children&rsquo;s
education being in helping their parents and families). The other
elements of its instruction ought to have respect to the trade by which it is
to live.</p>

<p>Modern systems of improvement are too apt to confuse the recreation of
the workman with his education. He should be educated for his work before
he is allowed to undertake it; and refreshed and relieved while he
practises it.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to induce the adoption of a national costume.
Cleanliness and neatness in dress ought always to be rewarded by
some gratification of personal pride; and it is the peculiar virtue of a
national costume that it fosters and gratifies the wish to look well, without
inducing the desire to look better than one&rsquo;s neighbors&mdash;or the hope, peculiarly
English, of being mistaken for a person in a higher position of life.
A costume may indeed become coquettish, but rarely indecent or vulgar;
and though a French bonne or Swiss farm-girl may dress so as sufficiently
to mortify her equals, neither of them ever desires or expects to be mistaken
for her mistress.</p>

<p><a name="ft9ac" id="ft9ac" href="#fa9ac"><span class="fn">9</span></a> This last book should be read carefully by all persons interested in
social questions. It is sufficiently dull as a tale, but is characterized throughout
by a restrained tragic power of the highest order; and it would be
worth reading, were it only for the story of Aenneli, and for the last half
page of its close.</p>

<p><a name="ft10ac" id="ft10ac" href="#fa10ac"><span class="fn">10</span></a> &ldquo;The Cumæan Sibyl, Deiphobe, was, in her youth, beloved by
Apollo; who, promising to grant her whatever she would ask, she took up
a handful of earth, and asked that she might live as many years as there
were grains of dust in her hand. She obtained her petition. Apollo would
have granted her perpetual youth in return for her love, but she denied him,
and wasted into the long ages&mdash;known, at last, only by her voice.&rdquo;&mdash;(See my
notes on the Turner Gallery.)</p>

<p><a name="ft11ac" id="ft11ac" href="#fa11ac"><span class="fn">11</span></a> Turner appears never to have desired, from any one, care in favor of
his separate works. The only thing he would say sometimes was, &ldquo;Keep
them together.&rdquo; He seemed not to mind how much they were injured, if
only the record of the thought were left in them, and they were kept in the
series which would give the key to their meaning. I never saw him, at my
father&rsquo;s house, look for an instant at any of his own drawings: I have
watched him sitting at dinner nearly opposite one of his chief pictures&mdash;his
eyes never turned to it.</p>

<p>But the want of appreciation, nevertheless, touched him sorely; chiefly
the not understanding his meaning. He tried hard one day for a quarter of
an hour to make me guess what he was doing in the picture of Napoleon,
before it had been exhibited, giving me hint after hint in a rough way; but
I could not guess, and he would not tell me.</p>

<p><a name="ft12ac" id="ft12ac" href="#fa12ac"><span class="fn">12</span></a> I limit myself in this book to mere indication of the tones of his mind,
illustration of them at any length being as yet impossible. It will be found
on examining the series of drawings made by Turner during the late years
of his life, in possession of the nation, that they are nearly all made for the
sake of some record of human power, partly victorious, partly conquered.
There is hardly a single example of landscape painted for its own abstract
beauty. Power and desolation, or soft pensiveness, are the elements sought
chiefly in landscape; hence the later sketches are nearly all among mountain
scenery, and chiefly of fortresses, villages or bridges and roads among
the wildest Alps. The pass of the St. Gothard, especially, from his earliest
days, had kept possession of his mind, not as a piece of mountain scenery,
but as a marvellous road; and the great drawing which I have tried to
illustrate with some care in this book, the last he made of the Alps with
unfailing energy, was wholly made to show the surviving of this tormented
path through avalanche and storm, from the day when he first drew its two
bridges, in the Liber Studiorum. Plate 81, which is the piece of the torrent
bed on the left, of the real size, where the stones of it appear just on
the point of being swept away, and the ground we stand upon with them,
completes the series of illustrations of this subject, for the present, sufficiently;
and, if compared with Plate 80, will be serviceable, also, in showing
how various in its grasp and its delight was this strange human mind,
capable of all patience and all energy, and perfect in its sympathy, whether
with wrath or quietness. Though lingering always with chief affection
about the St. Gothard pass, he seems to have gleaned the whole of Switzerland
for every record he could find of grand human effort of any kind; I
do not believe there is one baronial tower, one shattered arch of Alpine
bridge, one gleaming tower of decayed village or deserted monastery, which
he has not drawn; in many cases, round and round, again and again, on
every side. Now that I have done this work, I purpose, if life and strength
are spared to me, to trace him through these last journeys, and take such
record of his best-beloved places as may fully interpret the designs he left.
I have given in the three following plates an example of the kind of work
which needs doing, and which, as stated in the preface, I have partly already
begun. Plate 82 represents roughly two of Turner&rsquo;s memoranda of a
bridge over the Rhine. They are quite imperfectly represented, because I
do not choose to take any trouble about them on this scale. If I can engrave
them at all, it must be of their own size; but they are enough to give
an idea of the way he used to walk round a place, taking sketch after
sketch of its aspects, from every point or half-point of the compass. There
are three other sketches of this bridge, far more detailed than these, in the
National Gallery.</p>

<p>A scratched word on the back of one of them, &ldquo;Rheinfels,&rdquo; which I
knew could not apply to the Rheinfels near Bingen, gave me the clue to the
place;&mdash;an old Swiss town, seventeen miles above Basle, celebrated in Swiss
history as the main fortress defending the frontier toward the Black Forest.
I went there the moment I had got Turner&rsquo;s sketches arranged in 1858, and
drew it with the pen (or point of brush, more difficult to manage, but a better
instrument) on every side on which Turner had drawn it, giving every
detail with servile accuracy, so as to show the exact modifications he made
as he composed his subjects. Mr. Le Keux has beautifully copied two of
these studies, Plates 83 and 84; the first of these is the bridge drawn from
the spot whence Turner made his upper memorandum; afterwards, he
went down close to the fishing house, and took the second; in which he
unhesitatingly divides the Rhine by a strong pyramidal rock, in order to get
a group of firm lines pointing to his main subject, the tower (compare § 12,
p. 170, above); and throws a foaming mass of water away to the left, in
order to give a better idea of the river&rsquo;s force; the modifications of form in
the tower itself are all skilful and majestic in the highest degree. The
throwing the whole of it higher than the bridge, taking off the peak from
its gable on the left, and adding the little roof-window in the centre, make
it a perfectly noble mass, instead of a broken and common one. I have
added the other subject, Plate 84,&mdash;though I could not give the Turner
drawing which it illustrates,&mdash;merely to show the kind of scene which
modern ambition and folly are destroying throughout Switzerland. In
Plate 83, a small dark tower is seen in the distance, just on the left of the
tower of the bridge. Getting round nearly to the foot of it, on the outside
of the town, and then turning back so as to put the town walls on your
right, you may, I hope, still see the subject of the third plate; the old
bridge over the moat, and older wall and towers; the stork&rsquo;s nest on the
top of the nearest one; the moat itself, now nearly filled with softest grass
and flowers; a little mountain brook rippling down through the midst of
them, and the first wooded promontory of the Jura beyond. Had Rheinfelden
been a place of the least mark, instead of a nearly ruinous village, it
is just this spot of ground which, costing little or nothing, would have been
made its railroad station, and its refreshment-room would have been built
out of the stones of the towers.</p>

<p><a name="ft13ac" id="ft13ac" href="#fa13ac"><span class="fn">13</span></a> I have not followed out, as I ought to have done, had the task been less
painful, my assertion that Turner had to paint not only the labor and the
sorrow of men, but their death. There is no form of violent death which
he has not painted. Pre-eminent in many things, he is pre-eminent also,
bitterly, in this. Durer and Holbein drew the skeleton in its questioning;
but Turner, like Salvator, as under some strange fascination or captivity,
drew it at its work. Flood, and fire, and wreck, and battle, and pestilence;
and solitary death, more fearful still. The noblest of all the plates of the
Liber Studiorum, except the Via Mala, is one engraved with his own hand,
of a single sailor, yet living, dashed in the night against a granite coast,&mdash;his
body and outstretched hands just seen in the trough of a mountain
wave, between it and the overhanging wall of rock, hollow, polished, and
pale with dreadful cloud and grasping foam.</p>

<p>And remember, also, that the very sign in heaven itself which, truly
understood, is the type of love, was to Turner the type of death. The scarlet
of the clouds was his symbol of destruction. In his mind it was the color
of blood. So he used it in the Fall of Carthage. Note his own written
words&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;While o&rsquo;er the western wave the <i>ensanguined</i> sun,</p>
<p class="i05">In gathering huge a stormy signal spread,</p>
<p class="i05">And set portentous.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>So he used it in the Slaver, in the Ulysses, in the Napoleon, in the
Goldau; again and again in slighter hints and momentary dreams, of
which one of the saddest and most tender is a little sketch of dawn, made
in his last years. It is a small space of level sea shore; beyond it a fair,
soft light in the east; the last storm-clouds melting away, oblique into the
morning air; some little vessel&mdash;a collier, probably&mdash;has gone down in the
night, all hands lost; a single dog has come ashore. Utterly exhausted, its
limbs failing under it, and, sinking into the sand, it stands howling and
shivering. The dawn-clouds have the first scarlet upon them, a feeble
tinge only, reflected with the same feeble blood-stain on the sand.</p>

<p>The morning light is used with a loftier significance in a drawing made
as a companion to the Goldau, engraved in the fourth volume. The Lake
of Zug, which ripples beneath the sunset in the Goldau, is lulled in the level
azure of early cloud; and the spire of Aart, which is there a dark point at
the edge of the golden lake, is, in the opening light, seen pale against purple
mountains. The sketches for these two subjects were, I doubt not,
made from the actual effects of a stormy evening, and the next following
daybreak; but both with earnest meaning. The crimson sunset lights the
valley of rock tombs, cast upon it by the fallen Rossberg; but the sunrise
gilds with its level rays the two peaks which protect the village that gives
name to Switzerland; and the orb itself breaks first through the darkness
on the very point of the pass to the high lake of Egeri, where the liberties
of the cantons were won by the battle-charge of Morgarten.</p>

<p><a name="ft14ac" id="ft14ac" href="#fa14ac"><span class="fn">14</span></a> I have engraved, at the beginning of this chapter, one of the fragments
of these frescos, preserved, all imperfectly indeed, yet with some feeling of
their nobleness, by Zanetti, whose words respecting them I have quoted in
the text. The one I saw was the first figure given in his book; the one
engraved in my Plate, the third, had wholly perished; but even this record
of it by Zanetti is precious. What imperfections of form exist in it, too
visibly, are certainly less Giorgione&rsquo;s than the translator&rsquo;s; nevertheless, for
these very faults, as well as for its beauty, I have chosen it, as the best type
I could give of the strength of Venetian art; which was derived, be it remembered
always, from the acceptance of natural truth, by men who loved
beauty too well to think she was to be won by falsehood.</p>

<p>The words of Zanetti himself respecting Giorgione&rsquo;s figure of Diligence
are of great value, as they mark this first article of Venetian faith: &ldquo;Giorgione
per tale, o per altra che vi fosse, contrassegnolla con quella spezie di
mannaja che tiene in mano; per altro tanto ci cercava le sole bellezze della
natura, che poco pensando al costume, ritrasse qui una di quelle donne
Friulane, che vengono per servire in Venezia; non alterandone nemmeno
l&rsquo;abito, è facendola alquanto attempata, quale forse ci la vedea; senza voler
sapere che per rappresentare le Virtù, si suole da pittori belle è fresche giovani
immaginare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Compare with this what I have said of Titian&rsquo;s Magdalen. I ought in
that place to have dwelt also upon the firm endurance of all terribleness
which is marked in Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notomie&rdquo; and in Veronese&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marsyas.&rdquo; In
order to understand the Venetian mind entirely, the student should place a
plate from that series of the Notomie always beside the best engraving he
can obtain of Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My impression is that the ground of the flesh in these Giorgione frescos
had been pure vermilion; little else was left in the figure I saw. Therefore,
not knowing what power the painter intended to personify by the
figure at the commencement of this chapter, I have called her, from her
glowing color, Hesperid Æglé.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="center chap2">PEACE.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">§ 1. Looking</span> back over what I have written, I find that I
have only now the power of ending this work; it being time that
it should end, but not of &ldquo;concluding&rdquo; it; for it has led me
into fields of infinite inquiry, where it is only possible to break
off with such imperfect result as may, at any given moment,
have been attained.</p>

<p>Full of far deeper reverence for Turner&rsquo;s art than I felt when
this task of his defence was undertaken (which may, perhaps, be
evidenced by my having associated no other names with his&mdash;but
of the dead,&mdash;in my speaking of him throughout this volume),<a name="fa1ad" id="fa1ad" href="#ft1ad"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
I am more in doubt respecting the real use to mankind of that,
or any other transcendent art; incomprehensible as it must
always be to the mass of men. Full of far deeper love for what
I remember of Turner himself, as I become better capable of
understanding it, I find myself more and more helpless to explain
his errors and his sins.</p>

<p>§ 2. His errors, I might say, simply. Perhaps, some day,
people will again begin to remember the force of the old Greek
word for sin; and to learn that all sin is in essence&mdash;&ldquo;Missing
the mark;&rdquo; losing sight or consciousness of heaven; and that
this loss may be various in its guilt: it cannot be judged by us.
It is this of which the words are spoken so sternly, &ldquo;Judge not;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
which words people always quote, I observe, when they are called
upon to &ldquo;do judgment and justice.&rdquo; For it is truly a pleasant
thing to condemn men for their wanderings; but it is a bitter
thing to acknowledge a truth, or to take any bold share in working
out an equity. So that the habitual modern practical application
of the precept, &ldquo;Judge not,&rdquo; is to avoid the trouble of
pronouncing verdict, by taking, of any matter, the pleasantest
malicious view which first comes to hand; and to obtain licence
for our own convenient iniquities, by being indulgent to those of
others.</p>

<p>These two methods of obedience being just the two which are
most directly opposite to the law of mercy and truth.</p>

<p>§ 3. &ldquo;Bind them about thy neck.&rdquo; I said, but now, that of
an evil tree men never gathered good fruit. And the lesson we
have finally to learn from Turner&rsquo;s life is broadly this, that all
the power of it came of its mercy and sincerity; all the failure of
it, from its want of faith. It has been asked of me, by several of his
friends, that I should endeavor to do some justice to his character,
mistaken wholly by the world. If my life is spared, I will.
But that character is still, in many respects, inexplicable to me;
the materials within my reach are imperfect; and my experience
in the world not yet large enough to enable me to use them
justly. His life is to be written by a biographer, who will, I believe,
spare no pains in collecting the few scattered records which
exist of a career so uneventful and secluded. I will not anticipate
the conclusions of this writer; but if they appear to me
just, will endeavor afterwards, so far as may be in my power, to
confirm and illustrate them; and, if unjust, to show in what degree.</p>

<p>§ 4. Which, lest death or illness should forbid me, this only
I declare now of what I know respecting Turner&rsquo;s character.
Much of his mind and heart I do not know;&mdash;perhaps, never
shall know. But this much I do; and if there is anything in
the previous course of this work to warrant trust in me of any
kind, let me be trusted when I tell you, that Turner had a heart
as intensely kind, and as nobly true, as ever God gave to one of
his creatures. I offer, as yet, no evidence in this matter. When
I <i>do</i> give it, it shall be sifted and clear. Only this one fact I
now record joyfully and solemnly, that, having known Turner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
for ten years, and that during the period of his life when the
brightest qualities of his mind were, in many respects, diminished,
and when he was suffering most from the evil-speaking of the
world, I never heard him say one depreciating word of living
man, or man&rsquo;s work; I never saw him look an unkind or blameful
look; I never knew him let pass, without some sorrowful remonstrance,
or endeavor at mitigation, a blameful word spoken
by another.</p>

<p>Of no man but Turner, whom I have ever known, could I say
this. And of this kindness and truth<a name="fa2ad" id="fa2ad" href="#ft2ad"><span class="sp">2</span></a> came, I repeat, all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
highest power. And all his failure and error, deep and strange,
came of his faithlessness.</p>

<p>Faithlessness, or despair, the despair which has been shown
already (Vol. III., chap. xvi.) to be characteristic of this present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
century, and most sorrowfully manifested in its greatest men;
but existing in an infinitely more fatal form in the lower and
general mind, reacting upon those who ought to be its teachers.</p>

<p>§ 5. The form which the infidelity of England, especially, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
taken, is one hitherto unheard of in human history. No nation
ever before declared boldly, by print and word of mouth, that its
religion was good for show, but &ldquo;would not work.&rdquo; Over and
over again it has happened that nations have denied their gods,
but they denied them bravely. The Greeks in their decline
jested at their religion, and frittered it away in flatteries and fine
arts; the French refused theirs fiercely, tore down their altars
and brake their carven images. The question about God with
both these nations was still, even in their decline, fairly put,
though falsely answered. &ldquo;Either there is or is not a Supreme
Ruler; we consider of it, declare there is not, and proceed accordingly.&rdquo;
But we English have put the matter in an entirely new
light: &ldquo;There <i>is</i> a Supreme Ruler, no question of it, only He
cannot rule. His orders won&rsquo;t work. He will be quite satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
with euphonious and respectful repetition of them. Execution
would be too dangerous under existing circumstances, which He
certainly never contemplated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no conception of the absolute darkness which has covered
the national mind in this respect, until I began to come into
collision with persons engaged in the study of economical and
political questions. The entire naïveté and undisturbed imbecility
with which I found them declare that the laws of the
Devil were the only practicable ones, and that the laws of God
were merely a form of poetical language, passed all that I had
ever before heard or read of mortal infidelity. I knew the fool
had often said in his heart, there was <i>no</i> God; but to hear him
say clearly out with his lips, &ldquo;There is a foolish God,&rdquo; was something
which my art studies had not prepared me for. The
French had indeed, for a considerable time, hinted much of the
meaning in the delicate and compassionate blasphemy of their
phrase &ldquo;<i>le bon Dieu</i>,&rdquo; but had never ventured to put it into
more precise terms.</p>

<p>6. Now this form of unbelief in God is connected with, and
necessarily productive of, a precisely equal unbelief in man.</p>

<p>Co-relative with the assertion, &ldquo;There is a foolish God,&rdquo; is
the assertion, &ldquo;There is a brutish man.&rdquo; &ldquo;As no laws but
those of the Devil are practicable in the world, so no impulses
but those of the brute&rdquo; (says the modern political economist)
&ldquo;are appealable to in the world.&rdquo; Faith, generosity, honesty,
zeal, and self-sacrifice are poetical phrases. None of these things
can, in reality, be counted upon; there is no truth in man which
can be used as a moving or productive power. All motive force
in him is essentially brutish, covetous, or contentious. His
power is only power of prey: otherwise than the spider, he cannot
design; otherwise than the tiger, he cannot feed. This is the
modern interpretation of that embarrassing article of the Creed,
&ldquo;the communion of saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>7. It has always seemed very strange to me, not indeed that
this creed should have been adopted, it being the entirely necessary
consequence of the previous fundamental article;&mdash;but that
no one should ever seem to have any misgivings about it;&mdash;that,
practically, no one had <i>seen</i> how strong work <i>was</i> done by man;
how either for hire, or for hatred, it never had been done; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
that no amount of pay had ever made a good soldier, a good
teacher, a good artist, or a good workman. You pay your soldiers
and sailors so many pence a day, at which rated sum one
will do good fighting for you; another, bad fighting. Pay as
you will, the entire goodness of the fighting depends, always, on
its being done for nothing; or rather, less than nothing, in the
expectation of no pay but death. Examine the work of your
spiritual teachers, and you will find the statistical law respecting
them is, &ldquo;The less pay, the better work.&rdquo; Examine also your
writers and artists: for ten pounds you shall have a Paradise Lost,
and for a plate of figs, a Durer drawing; but for a million of
money sterling, neither. Examine your men of science: paid
by starvation, Kepler will discover the laws of the orbs of heaven
for you;&mdash;and, driven out to die in the street, Swammerdam
shall discover the laws of life for you&mdash;such hard terms do they
make with you, these brutish men, who can only be had for hire.</p>

<p>§ 8. Neither is good work ever done for hatred, any more
than hire&mdash;but for love only. For love of their country, or their
leader, or their duty, men fight steadily; but for massacre and
plunder, feebly. Your signal, &ldquo;England expects every man to
do his duty,&rdquo; they will answer; your signal of black flag and
death&rsquo;s head, they will not answer. And verily they will answer
it no more in commerce than in battle. The cross bones will not
make a good shop-sign, you will find ultimately, any more than
a good battle-standard. Not the cross bones, but the cross.</p>

<p>§ 9. Now the practical result of this infidelity in man, is the
utter ignorance of all the ways of getting his right work out of
him. From a given quantity of human power and intellect, to
produce the least possible result, is a problem solved, nearly with
mathematical precision, by the present methods of the nation&rsquo;s
economical procedure. The power and intellect are enormous.
With the best soldiers, at present existing, we survive in battle,
and but survive, because, by help of Providence, a man whom
we have kept all his life in command of a company forces his
way at the age of seventy so far up as to obtain permission to
save us, and die, unthanked. With the shrewdest thinkers in
the world, we have not yet succeeded in arriving at any national
conviction respecting the uses of life. And with the best artistical
material in the world, we spend millions of money in raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
a building for our Houses of Talk, of the delightfulness and utility
of which (perhaps roughly classing the Talk and its tabernacle
together), posterity will, I believe, form no very grateful
estimate;&mdash;while for sheer want of bread, we brought the question
to the balance of a hair, whether the most earnest of our
young painters should give up his art altogether, and go to Australia,&mdash;or
fight his way through all neglect and obloquy to the
painting of the Christ in the Temple.</p>

<p>§ 10. The marketing was indeed done in this case, as in all
others, on the usual terms. For the millions of money, we got
a mouldering toy: for the starvation, five years&rsquo;work of the
prime of a noble life. Yet neither that picture, great as it is,
nor any other of Hunt&rsquo;s, are the best he could have done. They
are the least he could have done. By no expedient could we have
repressed him more than he has been repressed; by no abnegation
received from him less than we have received.</p>

<p>My dear friend and teacher, Lowell, right as he is in almost
everything, is for once wrong in these lines, though with a noble
wrongness:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Disappointment&rsquo;s dry and bitter root,</p>
<p class="i05">Envy&rsquo;s harsh berries, and the choking pool</p>
<p class="i05">Of the world&rsquo;s scorn, are the right mother-milk</p>
<p class="i05">To the tough hearts that pioneer their kind.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>They are not so; love and trust are the only mother-milk of
any man&rsquo;s soul. So far as he is hated and mistrusted, his powers
are destroyed. Do not think that with impunity you can follow
the eyeless fool, and shout with the shouting charlatan; and
that the men you thrust aside with gibe and blow, are thus
sneered and crushed into the best service they can do you. I
have told you they <i>will</i> not serve you for pay. They <i>cannot</i> serve
you for scorn. Even from Balaam, money-lover though he be,
no useful prophecy is to be had for silver or gold. From Elisha,
savior of life though he be, no saving of life&mdash;even of children&rsquo;s,
who &ldquo;knew no better,&rdquo;&mdash;is to be got by the cry, Go up, thou
bald-head. No man can serve you either for purse or curse;
neither kind of pay will answer. No pay is, indeed, receivable
by any true man; but power is receivable by him, in the love
and faith you give him. So far only as you give him these can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
he serve you; that is the meaning of the question which his
Master asks always, &ldquo;Believest thou that I am able?&rdquo; And
from every one of His servants&mdash;to the end of time&mdash;if you give
them the Capernaum measure of faith, you shall have from
them Capernaum measure of works, and no more.</p>

<p>Do not think that I am irreverently comparing great and
small things. The system of the world is entirely one; small
things and great are alike part of one mighty whole. As the
flower is gnawed by frost, so every human heart is gnawed by
faithlessness. And as surely,&mdash;as irrevocably,&mdash;as the fruit-bud
falls before the east wind, so fails the power of the kindest
human heart, if you meet it with poison.</p>

<p>§ 11. Now the condition of mind in which Turner did all
his great work was simply this: &ldquo;What I do must be done
rightly; but I know also that no man now living in Europe cares
to understand it; and the better I do it, the less he will see the
meaning of it.&rdquo; There never was yet, so far as I can hear or
read, isolation of a great spirit so utterly desolate. Columbus
had succeeded in making other hearts share his hope, before he
was put to hardest trial; and knew that, by help of Heaven, he
could finally show that he was right. Kepler and Galileo could
demonstrate their conclusions up to a certain point; so far as
they felt they were right, they were sure that after death their
work would be acknowledged. But Turner could demonstrate
nothing of what he had done&mdash;saw no security that after death
he would be understood more than he had been in life. Only
another Turner could apprehend Turner. Such praise as he received
was poor and superficial; he regarded it far less than censure.
My own admiration of him was wild in enthusiasm, but
it gave him no ray of pleasure; he could not make me at that
time understand his main meanings; he loved me, but cared
nothing for what I said, and was always trying to hinder me
from writing, because it gave pain to his fellow artists. To the
praise of other persons he gave not even the acknowledgment of
this sad affection; it passed by him as murmur of the wind;
and most justly, for not one of his own special powers was ever
perceived by the world. I have said in another place that all
great modern artists will own their obligation to him as a guide.
They will; but they are in error in this gratitude, as I was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
when I quoted it as a sign of their respect. Close analysis of the
portions of modern art founded on Turner has since shown me
that in every case his imitators misunderstood him:&mdash;that they
caught merely at superficial brilliancies, and never saw the real
character of his mind or his work.</p>

<p>And at this day, while I write, the catalogue allowed to be
sold at the gates of the National Gallery for the instruction of
the common people, describes Calcott and Claude as the greater
artists.</p>

<p>§ 12. To censure, on the other hand, Turner was acutely sensitive,
owing to his own natural kindness; he felt it, for himself,
or for others, not as criticism, but as cruelty. He knew that
however little his higher powers could be seen, he had at least
done as much as ought to have saved him from wanton insult;
and the attacks upon him in his later years were to him not
merely contemptible in their ignorance, but amazing in their
ingratitude. &ldquo;A man may be weak in his age,&rdquo; he said to me
once, at the time when he felt he was dying; &ldquo;but you should
not tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 13. What Turner might have done for us, had he received
help and love, instead of disdain, I can hardly trust myself to
imagine. Increasing calmly in power and loveliness, his work
would have formed one mighty series of poems, each great as
that which I have interpreted,&mdash;the Hesperides; but becoming
brighter and kinder as he advanced to happy age. Soft as Correggio&rsquo;s,
solemn as Titian&rsquo;s, the enchanted color would have
glowed, imperishable and pure; and the subtle thoughts risen
into loftiest teaching, helpful for centuries to come.</p>

<p>What we have asked from him, instead of this, and what received,
we know. But few of us yet know how true an image
those darkening wrecks of radiance give of the shadow which
gained sway over his once pure and noble soul.</p>

<p>§ 14. Not unresisted, nor touching the heart&rsquo;s core, nor any
of the old kindness and truth: yet festering work of the worm&mdash;inexplicable
and terrible, such as England, by her goodly gardening,
leaves to infect her earth-flowers.</p>

<p>So far as in it lay, this century has caused every one of its
great men, whose hearts were kindest, and whose spirits most
perceptive of the work of God, to die without hope:&mdash;Scott,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
Keats, Byron, Shelley, Turner. Great England, of the Iron-heart
now, not of the Lion-heart; for these souls of her children an
account may perhaps be one day required of her.</p>

<p>§ 15. She has not yet read often enough that old story of the
Samaritan&rsquo;s mercy. He whom he saved was going down from
Jerusalem to Jericho&mdash;to the accursed city (so the old Church
used to understand it). He should not have left Jerusalem; it
was his own fault that he went out into the desert, and fell
among the thieves, and was left for dead. Every one of these
English children, in their day, took the desert bypath as he did,
and fell among fiends&mdash;took to making bread out of stones at
their bidding, and then died, torn and famished; careful England,
in her pure, priestly dress, passing by on the other side.
So far as we are concerned, that is the account <i>we</i> have to give
of them.<a name="fa3ad" id="fa3ad" href="#ft3ad"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>§ 16. So far as <i>they</i> are concerned, I do not fear for them;&mdash;there
being one Priest who never passes by. The longer I
live, the more clearly I see how all souls are in His hand&mdash;the
mean and the great. Fallen on the earth in their baseness, or
fading as the mist of morning in their goodness; still in the
hand of the potter as the clay, and in the temple of their master
as the cloud. It was not the mere bodily death that He conquered&mdash;that
death had no sting. It was this spiritual death
which He conquered, so that at last it should be swallowed up&mdash;mark
the word&mdash;not in life; but in victory. As the dead body
shall be raised to life, so also the defeated soul to victory, if only
it has been fighting on its Master&rsquo;s side, has made no covenant
with death; nor itself bowed its forehead for his seal. Blind
from the prison-house, maimed from the battle, or mad from
the tombs, their souls shall surely yet sit, astonished, at His feet
who giveth peace.</p>

<p>§ 17. Who <i>giveth</i> peace? Many a peace we have made and
named for ourselves, but the falsest is in that marvellous thought
that we, of all generations of the earth, only know the right;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
and that to us, at last,&mdash;and us alone,&mdash;all the scheme of God,
about the salvation of men, has been shown. &ldquo;This is the light
in which <i>we</i> are walking, Those vain Greeks are gone down to
their Persephone for ever&mdash;Egypt and Assyria, Elam and her
multitude,&mdash;uncircumcised, their graves are round about them&mdash;Pathros
and careless Ethiopia&mdash;filled with the slain. Rome,
with her thirsty sword, and poison wine, how did she walk in
her darkness! We only have no idolatries&mdash;ours are the seeing
eyes; in our pure hands at last, the seven-sealed book is laid; to
our true tongues entrusted the preaching of a perfect gospel.
Who shall come after us? Is it not peace? The poor Jew,
Zimri, who slew his master, there is no peace for him: but, for
us? tiara on head, may we not look out of the windows of
heaven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>§ 18. Another kind of peace I look for than this, though I
hear it said of me that I am hopeless.</p>

<p>I am not hopeless, though my hope may be as Veronese&rsquo;s, the
dark-veiled.</p>

<p>Veiled, not because sorrowful, but because blind. I do not
know what my England desires, or how long she will choose to
do as she is doing now;&mdash;with her right hand casting away the
souls of men, and with her left the gifts of God.</p>

<p>In the prayers which she dictates to her children, she tells
them to fight against the world, the flesh, and the devil. Some
day, perhaps, it may also occur to her as desirable to tell those
children what she means by this. What is the world which they
are to &ldquo;fight with,&rdquo; and how does it differ from the world which
they are to &ldquo;get on in&rdquo;? The explanation seems to me the
more needful, because I do not, in the book we profess to live
by, find anything very distinct about fighting with the world. I
find something about fighting with the rulers of its darkness,
and something also about overcoming it; but it does not follow
that this conquest is to be by hostility, since evil may be overcome
with good. But I find it written very distinctly that God
loved the world, and that Christ is the light of it.</p>

<p>§ 19. What the much-used words, therefore, mean, I cannot
tell. But this, I believe, they <i>should</i> mean. That there is, indeed,
one world which is full of care, and desire, and hatred: a
world of war, of which Christ is not the light, which indeed is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
without light, and has never heard the great &ldquo;Let there be.&rdquo;
Which is, therefore, in truth, as yet no world; but chaos, on the
face of which, moving, the Spirit of God yet causes men to hope
that a world will come. The better one, they call it: perhaps
they might, more wisely, call it the real one. Also, I hear them
speak continually of going to it, rather than of its coming to
them; which, again, is strange, for in that prayer which they
had straight from the lips of the Light of the world, and which
He apparently thought sufficient prayer for them, there is not
anything about going to another world; only something of
another government coming into this; or rather, not another,
but the only government,&mdash;that government which will constitute
it a world indeed. New heavens and new earth. Earth,
no more without form and void, but sown with fruit of righteousness.
Firmament, no more of passing cloud, but of cloud
risen out of the crystal sea&mdash;cloud in which, as He was once received
up, so He shall again come with power, and every eye
shall see Him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of
Him.</p>

<p>Kindreds of the earth, or tribes of it!<a name="fa4ad" id="fa4ad" href="#ft4ad"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;the &ldquo;earth-begotten,&rdquo;
the Chaos children&mdash;children of this present world, with
its desolate seas and its Medusa clouds: the Dragon children,
merciless: they who dealt as clouds without water: serpent
clouds, by whose sight men were turned into stone;&mdash;the time
must surely come for their wailing.</p>

<p>20. &ldquo;Thy kingdom come,&rdquo; we are bid to ask then! But
how shall it come? With power and great glory, it is written;
and yet not with observation, it is also written. Strange kingdom!
Yet its strangeness is renewed to us with every dawn.</p>

<p>When the time comes for us to wake out of the world&rsquo;s sleep,
why should it be otherwise than out of the dreams of the night?
Singing of birds, first, broken and low, as, not to dying eyes, but
eyes that wake to life, &ldquo;the casement slowly grows a glimmering
square;&rdquo; and then the gray, and then the rose of dawn; and last
the light, whose going forth is to the ends of heaven.</p>

<p>This kingdom it is not in our power to bring; but it is, to
receive. Nay, it has come already, in part; but not received,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
because men love chaos best; and the Night, with her daughters.
That is still the only question for us, as in the old Elias days,
&ldquo;If ye will receive it.&rdquo; With pains it may be shut out still from
many a dark place of cruelty; by sloth it may be still unseen for
many a glorious hour. But the pain of shutting it out must
grow greater and greater:&mdash;harder, every day, that struggle of
man with man in the abyss, and shorter wages for the fiend&rsquo;s
work. But it is still at our choice; the simoom-dragon may
still be served if we will, in the fiery desert, or else God walking
in the garden, at cool of day. Coolness now, not of Hesperus
over Atlas, stooped endurer of toil; but of Heosphorus over
Sion, the joy of the earth.<a name="fa5ad" id="fa5ad" href="#ft5ad"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The choice is no vague or doubtful
one. High on the desert mountain, full descried, sits throned
the tempter, with his old promise&mdash;the kingdoms of this world,
and the glory of them. He still calls you to your labor, as Christ
to your rest;&mdash;labor and sorrow, base desire, and cruel hope.
So far as you desire to possess, rather than to give; so far as you
look for power to command, instead of to bless; so far as your
own prosperity seems to you to issue out of contest or rivalry,
of any kind, with other men, or other nations; so long as the
hope before you is for supremacy instead of love; and your desire
is to be greatest, instead of least;&mdash;first, instead of last;&mdash;so
long you are serving the Lord of all that is last, and least;&mdash;the
last enemy that shall be destroyed&mdash;Death; and you shall have
death&rsquo;s crown, with the worm coiled in it; and death&rsquo;s wages
with the worm feeding on them; kindred of the earth shall you
yourself become; saying to the grave, &ldquo;Thou art my father;&rdquo;
and to the worm, &ldquo;Thou art my mother, and my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I leave you to judge, and to choose, between this labor, and
the bequeathed peace; this wages, and the gift of the Morning
Star; this obedience, and the doing of the will which shall enable
you to claim another kindred than of the earth, and to hear
another voice than that of the grave, saying, &ldquo;My brother, and
sister, and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1ad" id="ft1ad" href="#fa1ad"><span class="fn">1</span></a> It is proper, however, for the reader to know, that the title which I
myself originally intended for this book was &ldquo;<i>Turner and the Ancients</i>;&rdquo; nor
did I purpose to refer in it to any other modern painters than Turner. The
title was changed; and the notes on other living painters inserted in the
first volume, in deference to the advice of friends, probably wise; for unless
the change had been made, the book might never have been read at all.
But, as far as I am concerned, I regretted the change then, and regret it
still.</p>

<p><a name="ft2ad" id="ft2ad" href="#fa2ad"><span class="fn">2</span></a> It may perhaps be necessary to explain one or two singular points of
Turner&rsquo;s character, not in defence of this statement, but to show its meaning.
In speaking of his truth, I use the word in a double sense;&mdash;truth to
himself, and to others.</p>

<p>Truth to himself; that is to say, the resolution to do his duty by his art,
and carry all work out as well as it could be done. Other painters, for the
most part, modify their work by some reference to public taste, or measure
out a certain quantity of it for a certain price, or alter facts to show their
power. Turner never did any of these things. The thing the public asked
of him he would do, but whatever it was, only as <i>he</i> thought it ought to be
done. People did not buy his large pictures; he, with avowed discontent,
painted small ones; but instead of taking advantage of the smaller size to
give, proportionally, less labor, he instantly changed his execution so as to
be able to put nearly as much work into his small drawings as into his large
ones, though he gave them for half the price. But his aim was always to
make the drawing as good as he could, or as the subject deserved, irrespective
of price. If he disliked his theme, he painted it slightly, utterly disdainful
of the purchaser&rsquo;s complaint. &ldquo;The purchaser must take his
chance.&rdquo; If he liked his theme, he would give three hundred guineas&rsquo;
worth of work for a hundred, and ask no thanks. It is true, exceptionally,
that he altered the engravings from his designs, so as to meet the popular
taste, but this was because he knew the public could not be got otherwise to
look at his art at all. His own drawings the entire body of the nation repudiated
and despised: &ldquo;the engravers could make something of them,&rdquo;
they said. Turner scornfully took them at their word. If that is what you
like, take it. I will not alter my own noble work one jot for you, but these
things you shall have to your minds;&mdash;try to use them, and get beyond
them. Sometimes, when an engraver came with a plate to be touched, he
would take a piece of white chalk in his right hand and of black in his left:
&ldquo;Which will you have it done with?&rdquo; The engraver chose black or white,
as he thought his plate weak or heavy. Turner threw the other piece of
chalk away, and would reconstruct the plate, with the added lights or darks,
in ten minutes. Nevertheless, even this concession to false principles,
so far as it had influence, was injurious to him: he had better not have
scorned the engravings, but either done nothing with them, or done his best.
His best, in a certain way, he did, never sparing pains, if he thought the
plate worth it: some of his touched proofs are elaborate drawings.</p>

<p>Of his earnestness in his main work, enough, I should think, has been
already related in this book; but the following anecdote, which I repeat
here from my notes on the Turner Gallery, that there may be less chance of
its being lost, gives, in a few words, and those his own, the spirit of his
labor, as it possessed him throughout his life. The anecdote was communicated
to me in a letter by Mr. Kingsley, late of Sidney College, Cambridge;
whose words I give:&mdash;&ldquo;I had taken my mother and a cousin to see Turner&rsquo;s
pictures; and, as my mother knows nothing about art, I was taking her
down the gallery to look at the large Richmond Park, but as we were passing
the Sea-storm, she stopped before it, and I could hardly get her to look
at any other picture: and she told me a great deal more about it than I had
any notion of, though I had seen many sea-storms. She had been in such a
scene on the coast of Holland during the war. When, some time afterwards,
I thanked Turner for his permission for her to see the pictures, I told him
that he would not guess which had caught my mother&rsquo;s fancy, and then
named the picture; and he then said, &lsquo;I did not paint it to be understood,
but I wished to show what such a scene was like: I got the sailors to lash
me to the mast to observe it; I was lashed for four hours, and I did not expect
to escape, but I felt bound to record it if I did. But no one had any
business to like the picture.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;my mother once went through
just such a scene, and it brought it all back to her.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is your mother a
painter?&rsquo; &lsquo;No.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then she ought to have been thinking of something
else.&rsquo; These were nearly his words; I observed at the time, he used &lsquo;record&rsquo;
and &lsquo;painting,&rsquo; as the title &lsquo;author&rsquo; had struck me before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was true to others. No accusation had ever been brought forward
against Turner by his most envious enemies, of his breaking a promise, or
failing in an undertaken trust. His sense of justice was strangely acute; it
was like his sense of balance in color, and shone continually in little crotchets
of arrangement of price, or other advantages, among the buyers of his pictures.
For instance, one of my friends had long desired to possess a picture
which Turner would not sell. It had been painted with a companion;
which was sold, but this reserved. After a considerable number of years
had passed, Turner consented to part with it. The price of canvases of its
size having, in the meantime, doubled, question arose as to what was then
to be its price. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Turner, &ldquo;Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had the companion for so
much. You must be on the same footing.&rdquo; This was in no desire to do my
friend a favor; but in mere instinct of equity. Had the price of his pictures
fallen, instead of risen in the meantime, Turner would have said, &ldquo;Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
paid so much, and so must you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the best proof to which I can refer in this character of his mind is in
the wonderful series of diagrams executed by him for his lectures on perspective
at the Royal Academy. I had heard it said that these lectures were
inefficient. Barely intelligible in expression they might be; but the zealous
care with which Turner endeavored to do his duty, is proved by a series of
large drawings, exquisitely tinted, and often completely colored, all by his
own hand, of the most difficult perspective subjects; illustrating not only
directions of line, but effects of light, with a care and completion which
would put the work of any ordinary teacher to utter shame. In teaching
generally, he would neither waste his time nor spare it; he would look over
a student&rsquo;s drawing, at the academy,&mdash;point to a defective part, make a
scratch on the paper at the side, saying nothing; if the student saw what
was wanted, and did it, Turner was delighted, and would go on with him,
giving hint after hint; but if the student could not follow, Turner left him.
Such experience as I have had in teaching, leads me more and more to perceive
that he was right. Explanations are wasted time. A man who can
see, understands a touch; a man who cannot, misunderstands an oration.</p>

<p>One of the points in Turner which increased the general falseness of
impression respecting him was a curious dislike he had to <i>appear</i> kind.
Drawing, with one of his best friends, at the bridge of St. Martin&rsquo;s, the
friend got into great difficulty over a colored sketch. Turner looked over
him a little while, then said, in a grumbling way&mdash;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any
paper I like; let me try yours.&rdquo; Receiving a block book, he disappeared
for an hour and a half. Returning, he threw the book down, with a growl,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make anything of your paper.&rdquo; There were three sketches
on it, in three distinct states of progress, showing the process of coloring
from beginning to end, and clearing up every difficulty which his friend
had got into. When he gave advice, also, it was apt to come in the form of
a keen question, or a quotation of some one else&rsquo;s opinion, rarely a statement
of his own. To the same person producing a sketch, which had no
special character: &ldquo;What are you in <i>search</i> of?&rdquo; Note this expression.
Turner knew that passionate seeking only leads to passionate finding.
Sometimes, however, the advice would come with a startling distinctness.
A church spire having been left out in a sketch of a town&mdash;&ldquo;Why did you
not put that in?&rdquo; &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you should take a subject
more suited to your capacity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many people would have gone away considering this an insult, whereas
it was only a sudden flash from Turner&rsquo;s earnest requirement of wholeness
or perfectness of conception. &ldquo;Whatever you do, large or small, do it
wholly; take a slight subject if you will, but don&rsquo;t leave things out.&rdquo; But
the principal reason for Turner&rsquo;s having got the reputation of always refusing
advice was, that artists came to him in a state of mind in which he
knew they could not receive it. Virtually, the entire conviction of the
artists of his time respecting him was, that he had got a secret, which he
could tell, if he liked, that would make them all Turners. They came to
him with this general formula of request clearly in their hearts, if not
definitely on their lips: &ldquo;You know, Mr. Turner, we are all of us quite as
clever as you are, and could do all that very well, and we should really like
to do a little of it occasionally, only we haven&rsquo;t quite your trick; there&rsquo;s
something in it, of course, which you only found out by accident, and it is
very ill-natured and unkind of you not to tell us how the thing is done;
what do you rub your colors over with, and where ought we to put in the
black patches?&rdquo; This was the practical meaning of the artistical questioning
of his day, to which Turner very resolvedly made no answer. On the
contrary, he took great care that any tricks of execution he actually did use
should not be known.</p>

<p>His <i>practical</i> answer to their questioning being as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;You are
indeed, many of you, as clever as I am; but this, which you think a secret,
is only the result of sincerity and toil. If you have not sense enough to see
this without asking me, you have not sense enough to believe me, if I tell
you. True, I know some odd methods of coloring. I have found them
out for myself, and they suit me. They would not suit you. They would
do you no real good; and it would do me much harm to have you mimicking
my ways of work, without knowledge of their meaning. If you want
methods fit for you, find them out for yourselves. If you cannot discover
them, neither could you use them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft3ad" id="ft3ad" href="#fa3ad"><span class="fn">3</span></a> It is strange that the last words Turner ever attached to a picture
should have been these:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;The priest held the poisoned cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">Compare the words of 1798 with those of 1850.</p>
